# FAQ

## General 
### What is Akropolis?
Akropolis is a domain-specific financial protocol dedicated to the needs of the informal economy. It makes it possible for anybody regardless of geography to quickly set up, operate and grow scalable autonomous financial organizations. Most importantly, it enables an interoperable network between them and external third parties, whereby value can be exchanged freely in a trust-minimised way (e.g. co-invest, lend/borrow, trade).

### What problem are you seeking to solve?
The protocol is designed to enable scalability of informal member-owned trust-based organisations. This is envisaged as an alternative to challenged centralised institutions mandated with providing pensions/banking/social insurance.

### How do you know it is a valid problem with verified demand?
The problem of insolvency of centralised pensions and social security institutions is a well documented one. Please see our library of resources here. For a 5-minute overview, we recommend you watch this compilation and a full documentary is available here.

### Are you building a consumer application? 

No, we are not. Our product is a protocol that enables creation of scalable robust decentralised p2p alternatives to centrally controlled pension/social security funds.
At the protocol level, speed and immediately finality are not as relevant as 

The technology is not ready yet and scalability remains a challenge for consumer-level applications.


### What are informal savings groups (ISG)? Why are they important? 

Savings groups are member-owned institutions, typically <20 members who save together and take small loans from the common savings pool or invest together and then share profits. [Savings Groups are simple, transparent, autonomous and locally run](https://sites.worldvision.ca/savingsgroups/). Members provide their own savings and credit services at negligible cost, while retaining earnings and investment in their own communities.

Savings groups have proven to be one of the most effective, low-cost alternative mechanisms to provide basic financial services for people that have difficulties in receiving those services from traditional financial institutions. Informal savings groups and closely linked to diaspora remittances and are an existing element of most emerging markets economies. 




### What are autonomous financial organisations (AFO)? 

Autonomous financial organisations are fully digital member-owned organisations that provide financial services such as co-savings and co-investing, access to credit on flexible terms, a basic form of insurance etc. AFOs make decisions independently on their own behalf, as well as on behalf of their owners (individuals or corporations). Informal Savings Groups is a basic existing primitive of AFOs. 



### Why emerging markets (EM)? Is your focus on EM only?

Mass adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology will take place in areas with poorly developed legacy financial infrastructure, where cryptocurrency is adds real value and is a superior alternative to currently available choices, with relatively low cognitive switching cost. The emerging economies of Africa and Asia have been using mobile money (e.g. mPesa in Kenya) for over a decade, whilst Europe and US are discovering mobile-first remittances only now. 

For centuries trust-based communities have been providing financial services where 
formal financial institutions failed to provide. In emerging markets savings groups and the community-based microfinance model not only exist but also form an essential backbone of what is known as “informal economy”. 

The market size of billion dollars, lack of traditional financial system legacy, the rapid penetration of digital technologies and principles of work of informal savings groups in emerging markets as basic AFOs make them our initial target audience.

Without imposing new behavioural patterns on users who have already been operating like this for years, we help informal savings circle leapfrog to member-owned banks by making them scaleable, fraud-proof, and geography-agnostic using the blockchain technology.

However, our focus is not limited to emerging markets. We believe the future of finance belongs to user-owned networks in developed countries as well. Banks and other financial corporations will be replaced by autonomous co-ops, each of which will act in the interests of its owners and interact with other agents in a single digital financial landscape. Hence we are designing our products to serve people’s needs today, tomorrow, and in the future.

### What services are planned to be available for AFOs? 

The Akropolis protocol allows you to create any cashflow-based financial services that cover most of the existing financial products for retail users:

* Savings

* Investments

* Credits 


## Technology

### Why is there a need to use blockchain and what does it uniquely enable that wouldn’t otherwise be possible?

The work of the financial system is ensured by the work of institutions that resolve issues of trust between banking organizations and the public. So far it has been solved by implementing complex rules and laws by governments. However, if the state can’t cope with this function, the financial system doesn’t work effectively. 

Technology can help to revolutionize the world we live for the better. One of the possible solutions to solve the trust issue lies in Blockchain. “Code is a law” principle allows to build a new stable and reliable financial stack, which will work regardless of borders / governments, etc.


### Will you be building your own blockchain?

No, we are not building our own blockchain. Designed as a blockchain-agnostic protocol, Akropolis is currently being implemented on Ethereum, the next iteration will be built using [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/), with active R&D underway. 


### What are the building blocks of Akropolis protocol?

C2FC, DCDM, Identity Management System,  Accounting and Reputation system. 



### What is C2FC?

Commitments to Future Cashflows  (or C2FC) – a financial primitive that represents a digital right to operate with future cashflow that will arrive in any form to any Ethereum address (now it works in Ethereum, but could be implemented in any blockchain)within a given time frame. Simply put, it looks like a relay: a C2FC issuer must receive payment within this specified period, but those payments are fully or partially forwarded to the C2FC token holder’s address. Therefore, the future cashflow of any individual, company or service takes the form of a measurable digital unit that can be easily exchanged, traded or used as collateral.


### What is Digital Community Decision Making (DCDM)?

AFOs work as decentralised autonomous organisations. The governance inside each AFO is different from a protocol governance as only AFO members are able to make decisions thus there is no need for the internal token in every autonomous financial organisation. 

The Digital Community Decision Making (DCDM) Framework provides decision support for Autonomous Financial Organisations. The core DCDM API supports a number of base level commands, like registration of new Autonomous Financial Organisation, making changes to its constitution etc. 


### What is Identity Management System (IMS)? 

IMS is analogous to Ethereum Naming service, which keep the following records:

* Registry of all users of the protocol and links to user’s external personal data providers, e.g. hash with a document copy or IPFS link 

* List of all created AFOs

* List of all created AFO members

### Do you provide a scoring system?

We do not centrally store protocol user data or provide scoring and risk assessment within the protocol. In a decentralised manner, all financial transactions of agents are stored on-chain. Any third-party can access pseudo-anonymised  transactions on-chain and assess the risk on their own or use third-parties to assess the risk. 

Off-chain information may be elected to be shared by AFOs in order to get access to competitively-priced credit from external capital providers. As a result, a third-party can combine various data sources to create n scoring system.

When Ethereum anonymisation and gas-effective zk-snarks solution is created, we will seek to apply it to the protocol. We continue monitoring the ecosystem, e.g. Aztec protocol. 

### What is DeFi? What is your place in DeFi ecosystem?

[Decentralized finance (#defi)](https://defi.network) is the movement that leverages open source software and decentralized networks to transform traditional financial products into trustless and transparent protocols that operate without unnecessary intermediaries.

DeFi is by far the most promising area of blockchain application, with a number of high-quality interoperable projects promising the future of transparent, fully auditable, efficient peer-to-peer interactions, based both on existing financial primitives and creating novel ways to generate and exchange value. However, DeFi is still very much looking for its product-market fit beyond the immediate community of developers and sophisticated speculators. We are building an alternative savings infrastructure that can be tested by informal savings groups (or AFOs) in emerging markets now.
