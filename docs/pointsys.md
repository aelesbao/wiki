# Community Quest Points &amp; Rewards System

## Points: What are they?

The Akropolis Community Quest (ACQ) uses a points system to accurately assign rewards to active participants of our community venture. Points are earned for actions you take during the quest (e.g. solving the challenging puzzles, creating amazing content and adding value to the community by other means). Points rate in dollars is 1 point = 1 USD in AKT. A minimum of 150 points is required for successful conversion of ACQ points to AKT. Lesser amounts can only be redeemed for bonuses (check below for more info!).

## Where can I see how much points I earned?

We created a special bot for you - the almighty [Akrobot](https://t.me/Akropolisbot)!
Simply start it to see some magic! :) <br/>We will be updating amount of points everyday, after 6 PM UTC.

P.S. You need to have a TG handle (starting with @) to check check the amount of points you earned.
