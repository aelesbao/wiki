# From Nationalization to Privatization to Decentralization

Is the Blockchain the Next Step in Public Services?

In 1969, Peter Drucker wrote an essay called **&quot;**** the sickness of government&quot;**_._ In the essay, he argued that the world&#39;s state-run businesses were ineffective, underfunded and poorly managed.

His words echoed how many people felt about the bloated post-WW2 public sector. **It&#39;s no surprise that, just years later, Margaret Thatcher started Britain&#39;s privatization boom.** British Telecom, British Gas and even the British Transport Docks Board were just a few of the companies sold off.

**The results were positive.** The British government raised over [£50 bn](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/alistair-osborne/9980292/Margaret-Thatcher-one-policy-that-led-to-more-than-50-companies-being-sold-or-privatised.html), and many of the privatized companies are now examples of efficiency and professionalism. Seeing this, over 100 countries have followed Thatcher&#39;s lead, with $3.3 trillion in assets passing [into private ownership](https://capx.co/thatchers-golden-legacy-of-privatisation/) since the &#39;70s.

But there is still a lot to privatize and decentralize. Governments are still too bloated and inefficient in some areas. **Fortunately, the blockchain may be a perfect solution.** This is why Mariya Gabriel, the EC&#39;s Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society, has gone on record to say that: [**in the future, all public services will use Blockchain technology**](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/european-countries-join-blockchain-partnership)​

Why is the public sector so bullish on the blockchain — and what can we gain by using this new technology to provide public services? You can gain more insights about this topic, starting with…

**Why Privatization Worked**

In the past, working for a nationalized company was all about not rocking the boat. Workers retired early, were guaranteed wages, and had a strong union lobby. Their objective was holding on to their standards of living; not to innovate or do good work.

As a result, people were disappointed and frustrated with many state-run firms. Eventually, Margaret Thatcher decided to privatize Britain&#39;s public companies. Hundreds of governments followed suit.

**This worked because it:**

1. **Encouraged fair competition, pushing prices down and quality up**
2. **Discouraged ineffective state monopolies from misappropriating resources**
3. **Made it so politics and enterprise were separated and run separately**

Since then, the trend towards decentralization has continued. Economic growth has increased, capital markets have grown, and living standards have increased. For all these reasons, governments are looking to externalize and privatize ever-more of their operations.

Here, once again, Britain is leading the way. Many local councils and government-run companies are delegating their online operations to private companies.

The UK&#39;s G-Cloud — an array of software services for state organizations — has already brought in [£3.2 bn in sales](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-spend-on-digital-services-passes-3bn-mark). **And now, both the EU and the UK are looking to use the blockchain to decentralize public services further**. Here&#39;s how (and why).

**Moving Towards the Blockchain**

So far, **the blockchain** has been synonymous with **cryptocurrencies**. But **the EU&#39;s 20 member states** feel that the blockchain should be used to **decentralize** services, rather than to create financial instruments. According to the Declaration on a European Blockchain Partnership, the outlook is to create [**value-based, trusted, user-centric digital services**](https://cointelegraph.com/news/united-in-diversity-a-blueprint-for-the-pan-european-distributed-ledger)_._

**What does this mean?**

It means that the EU is already thinking ahead to how the blockchain will help privatize more government operations. This means that in the future, we could see blockchain protocols that **denationalize** and **decentralize** :

- **Healthcare**
- **Childcare**
- **Education**
- **Pensions**

This would **improve efficiency**. It would **push down costs**. And, in the case of pensions, it may even **fix a worldwide pension gap** projected to grow to **$400 trillion by 2050**.
