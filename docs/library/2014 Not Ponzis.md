_All pensions are claims on the earnings of a future generation_

All pensions are claims on the earnings of a future generation. A state-funded pension is clearly a claim on future taxpayers. A funded plan, whether final salary/defined benefit or defined contribution, invests in government bonds (a different claim on future taxpayers), equities and corporate bonds (claims on future profits, which are generated by future workers) or property (claims on future rents, generated by future workers).

To keep going, then, any pension scheme needs a new batch of workers. Each generation need not necessarily be larger than the last but they need to be more productive. Imagine, in extremis, that the people of America or Britain produced only one surving descendant. This child might race around like a one-armed paperhanger, but could not possibly sustain the stock and bond markets on his or her own. Yes, in theory, citizens of one country could amass pension claims in the form of overseas assets (and thus have claims on foreign workers). But that would only work in the context of years of current account surpluses, which has not been the case in most of the developed world.

What differentiates different pension schemes is the clarity of the claims being made, and the costs involved. In a classic DB scheme, the claims of the worker are very clear; a proportion of his or her final salary, which may or may not be inflation-linked. The lack of clarity is on the cost side; employers, particularly in the public sector, have underestimated the cost, which has been inflated by improved longevity and lower-than-expected investment returns. In a classic DC scheme, the cost to the employers is clear but the benefit to the worker is not; in fact the outcome is a bit of a [lottery](http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21602704-average-returns-investments-retirement-conceal-huge-variation-pensions-la).

A collective DC scheme tries to finagle this problem by giving workers a claim, but a claim that can be reduced if the assets fall short of tareget. As John Ralfe [points out in FTFM](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b4711a2c-f225-11e3-ac7a-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=uk#axzz34mywXiLp), this creates some complex intergenerational issues, such as whether workers have the right to withdraw their assets. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s right to call them &quot;Ponzi cons&quot; as those are outright frauds, and that is not really the case. In a [column three years ago](http://www.economist.com/node/21530106), I tried to spell out the distinction between a pyramid and a Ponzi. But this is all about trade-offs between costs and benefits; there is no perfect answer.
