## What is the Delphi Pool?

Delphi is a pool built on AkropolisOS. Delphi allows executing automatic dollar-cost averaging into BTC&ETH (this diversifying long-term investment portfolio) and participating in different yield harvesting (liquidity mining) possibilities. More details to be announced.
