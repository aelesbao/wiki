## What is Akropolis

## Vision 

Our vision is to build a better pensions infrastructure focusing on transparency, automation and portability. Our approach is a bottom-up re-write and redesign, centered on a more competitive model, associated infrastructure and necessary tools to create a reliable and hazard-free pension landscape.

Akropolis is designed in a way that is inclusive, reliable and transparent. Users do not need to acquire permission to set up funds on Akropolis, which is designed to be owned by token holders over time. Akropolis focuses on a specific use case and seeks to address it in an open-source tradition.


## Mission

!!! quote 
	We will see many blockchains in the future, regional differentiation - already confirmed empirically, hence inter-chain communication is important. 
	(Olof Karlsson-Wee, Polychain Capital) 

A paradigm shift is required.

We need a whole new model to replace the current broken pensions model: we are building thin slices of the Web3 stack as the rails to help us get there. It is with the decentralised Web3 stack can we believe we can build that which we cannot imagine in a traditional environment?

Underlying protocols can lead the emergence of new applications and can drive an ecosystem.

Distributed network, where the users of the network are the owners of the network: no adversarial/conflicting relationships between the stakeholders or moral hazard negatively affecting the outcomes for the users.
