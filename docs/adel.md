### **AKRO Tokenomic**

### Token Utility

Product-level governance for Delphi users and contributors, e.g:

- Further protocol integrations

- What assets/pools to whitelist

- Discount on fees

- Inflation/Deflation

In order to govern Delphi, AKRO tokenholders need to stake AKRO to receive ADEL, to ensure their interests are fairly represented.

### Value accrual

Value accrual through claim on Delphi fees and utility, not inflation;

ADEL accrues value and is charged with product-specific governance;

ADEL stakers have a major entitlement to Delphi economics (20% AKRO/80%ADEL) (subject to change):

- Exit/entry fees

- Performance fees

- Exchange referral fees

### Sources of Interest

Initial sources of yield or gains, more to be added:

- Supply interest from Compound/AAVE/dYdX/bZx
- Trading fees from Curve, Balancer, Uniswap
- BAL, COMP, SNX, REN etc token mining
- CRV token mining(upcoming)
- YFI mining from staking yCurve
- yearn protocol fee(COMP, LEND, etc.)*

### How can I get it?

- Earn by providing liquidity (stablecoins, AKRO or other tokens) to Delphi;

- Earn by participating in Delphi product governance, i.e. voting and creating proposals that pass;
