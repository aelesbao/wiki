# 5 Times Pension Schemes Collapsed and Left Millions of People Destitute  —  Part I

_Pension schemes go **bankrupt**._ _Governments bail them out, or banks absorb their obligations._ **Business carries on as usual**_._

This is a recurring pattern in the world economy. Pension plans fail, and someone steps in to save them. This is why the US has a Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation; why most EU governments fund pensions out of current taxes; why Brazil spends a whopping [11.3% of its GDP](https://www.imf.org/external/np/blog/dialogo/120116.pdf) on pensions.

It&#39;s **that** important that pensions get paid. And since pension schemes often find themselves broke or underfunded, 3rd parties intervene a lot.

But what happens when pension schemes go broke and nobody steps in to save the day? What happens when pension schemes, funds and systems collapse permanently?

In this 3-part series, we&#39;ll show you **5 real-life outcomes** of **complete pension scheme failure**. In the first part, we&#39;ll look at a Stateside example: that of **Prichard, Alabama**.

1. Prichard, Alabama

Many people feel that living in an OECD country protects their pension. As you&#39;re about to see, they are wrong. The EU, the US and other developed countries can all leave retirees penniless. Here&#39;s one example.

Prichard, Alabama, is a small town on the outskirts of Mobile, Alabama. Its pension fund was running out of money for years — but the town&#39;s administration ignored all warnings. **By 2009, Prichard&#39;s pension fund was 100% dry…**

So Prichard [just stopped paying its 150+ retirees](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/23/business/23prichard.html). This was in clear violation of state laws, but that didn&#39;t matter. Pensioners like Nettie Banks, a retired police and fire dispatcher, were left with no recourse to public funds.

Other local stories were even more unfortunate.

Police Captain Eddie Ragland was left unable to work after being badly wounded by a robber. Aged 59 and with no state pension, he had to rely on donations, bake sale proceeds and his neighbors to survive.

Another Prichard pensioner  —  the retired fire marshal  —  refused such help, and lived with no electricity or running water until found dead.

The Prichard example shows that it doesn&#39;t matter **where** you live. The government isn&#39;t always going to step in to help. As a pensioner, you can find yourself poor in a heartbeat  —  even if you live in a developed country where you worked as a state employee.

In fact, the next part of this 3-part series will look at how Britain&#39;s government misappropriated the National Bus company&#39;s funds in the 70s, leaving the latter&#39;s pension scheme underfunded.
