Since the middle of the last century, life expectancy has been increasing rapidly. On average, it has been increasing by one year, every five years (see Figure 1). Babies born today in 2017 can expect to live to over 1001 , or in other words, they will live to see the year 2117.

While increased longevity is a positive step for individual and societal health and productivity, this change has a profound impact on the traditional make-up of our societies and the social protection systems that are designed to support us in our old age.

In Japan, which has one of the world&#39;s most rapidly ageing populations, retirement can begin at 602,3. This could result in a retirement of over 45 years for those who will live to the current life expectancy of 1071 (see Figure 2). What is the impact of a population that will spend 20%-25% more time in retirement than they did in the workforce? How do we rethink our retirement systems that were designed to support a retirement of 10–15 years to prepare for this seismic shift?Challenges facing global retirement systems.

One obvious implication of living longer is that we are going to have to spend longer working. The expectation that retirement will start early-to-mid-60s is likely to be a thing of the past, or a privilege of the very wealthy.

Absent any change to retirement ages, or expected birth rates, the global dependency ratio (the ratio of those in the workforce to those in retirement) will plummet from 8:1 today to 4:1 by 2050. The global economy simply can&#39;t bear this burden. Inevitably retirement ages will rise, but by how much and how quickly demands urgent consideration from policymakers.Longevity has been increasing steadily since the middle of the 20th century.

Given the rise in longevity and the declining dependency ratio, policy-makers must immediately consider how to foster a functioning labour market for older workers to extend working careers as much as possible. Employers also have a key role to play in helping workers reskill and adapt their work styles to support a longer working career.
