It makes it possible for anybody regardless of geography to quickly set up, operate and grow scalable autonomous financial organizations. Most importantly, it enables an inter-operable network between them and external third parties, whereby value can be exchanged freely in a trust-minimised way (e.g. co-invest, loan/borrow, trade) What are autonomous financial organizations? Autonomous financial organizations are fully digital organizations that provide financial services and can make decisions independently on their own behalf, as well as on behalf of their owners (individuals or corporations). Why are we focused on emerging markets? In emerging markets, an informal financial market has been operating for hundreds of years. This market consists of millions of financial organizations, each of which solves the financial problems of their owners. These financial organizations, informal savings groups, hold 100s of billions of US $ 240 bln US $. The principles of the work of the savings groups do very much resemble the principles of the AFO, so we regard them as the initial target audience Are we addressed only to emerging markets? No. we are not. We believe the future of finance belongs to user-owned networks. Fintech trends confirm that. Banks and other financial corporations will be replaced by a huge number of autonomous co-ops, each of which will act in the interests of its owners and interact with other agents in a single digital financial landscape. How do we transform the informal economy into a brand new digital communities? We chose the initial target audience to launch our protocol to Africa due to two reasons - the lack of traditional financial system legacy and the rapid penetration of digital technologies. We help informal savings circle leapfrog to member-owned banks. In the same way as EM leapfrogged into telecom and mobile era faster than Europe What services can AFOs create? The Akropolis protocol allows you to create any cashflow-based financial services that cover most of the existing financial products for retail users: loans/savings/insurance/joint investments etc. Which blockchain does Akropolis use? Designed as a blockchain-agnostic protocol, Akropolis is currently being implemented on Ethereum, the next iteration will be built using Polkadot, with active R&D underway. What are building blocks of Akropolis protocol? C2FC, DCDM, Identity Management System, Bookkeeping and Reputation system. What is C2FC? Commitments to Future Cashflows (or C2FC) \u2013 a financial primitive that represents a digital right to operate with future cashflow that will arrive in any form to any Ethereum address (now it works in Ethereum, but could be implemented in any blockchain)within a given time frame. Simply put, it looks like a relay: a C2FC issuer must receive payment within this specified period, but those payments are fully or partially forwarded to the C2FC token holder\u2019s address. Therefore, the future cashflow of any individual, company or service takes the form of a measurable digital unit that can be easily exchanged, traded or used as collateral. What is DCDM? The DCDM (Digital Community Decision Making) Framework provides decision support for autonomous financial organizations. The core DCDM API supports a number of base level commands, like registration of new Autonomous Financial Organisation, making changes to its constitution etc. What is Identity Management System? IMS is a registry of all users, which keep next records: List of all users of the protocol and links to user\u2019s external personal data providers List of all registred AFOs * List of memberships of users in AFOs. How does the Reputation system work? We do not provide scoring and risk assessment within the protocol. The protocol collects and stores information about all financial transactions of agents. Any third-party participant can access financial transactions and assess the risk on their own or use third-parties to assess the risk.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"FAQ/#faq","text":"","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"FAQ/#what-is-akropolis","text":"Akropolis is a domain-specific financial protocol dedicated to the needs of the informal economy.

Built with MakerDAO + 0x + MetaMask TestNetApp (Kovan) Mainnet App What is C2FC The C2FC is a digital token, which acts as automatically executed right to claim a defined part of the future cashflow that arrives at issuer Ethereum address within a given time frame. C2FC is materially different to the current implementations of ERC948 (EIP 1337) and EIP1620. The improvement is in the following features: Direct debit initialisation by the sender Ability to realize escrow logic for payments receiver Ability to transfer ownership to receive recurring payments: transferred to another person Tokens are composable and can be grouped into a portfolio according to pre-defined characteristics What are the benefits C2FC issuance allows to present future cashflows of any business or individual in as a single token, that can be easily exchanged, traded or used as collateral, thus materially simplifying workflows and opening up a potential for new DeFi instruments and interactions. You can attract additional liquidity without using a 150% ensuring in digital assets by trading C2FC. How does it work An already operating business or an individual who has regular income payments, that needs additional liquidity at the moment can issue C2FC for defined future periods and trade them at marketplace. It looks like exchanging future cashflows for \"money now\" by selling discounted C2FC or borrowing funds, using C2FC as collateral. Are there any risks involved in issuing or trading C2FCs? C2FC issuance itself does not provide any risks until it is involved in the open market. When it is exchanged to other unit of value and changed ownership, there is a risk that future cashflow would be lower than estimated or there would no money arrived at all. This issue primarily is connected with the correct risk assessment of the C2FC issuer. Considering the transparency of the C2FC itself and related indicators, the risk assessment would be no harder and in some cases can even be more reliable than in centralized finance.

Individuals also find it difficult to move their savings from one provider to another or from one jurisdiction to another. Savers don't understand what they are paying and whether they will get back their savings: Due to the mandatory nature of most pensions systems, there is normally a lack of transparency on charges levied on contributors. An individual does not know if their savings is underperforming, what conditions those savings can be withdrawn or even if their pension scheme is solvent. Pension pools are fragmented: In some markets such as the UK, pension pools are fragmented and administered by various parties (large employers, municipalities, etc.) due to a variety of legacy issues. This makes it complicated and is inefficient for savers.
