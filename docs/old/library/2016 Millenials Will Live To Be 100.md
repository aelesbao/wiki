# Millennials Will Live To Be 100-Years Old, But Will Their Pensions?

**What&#39;s the Problem and Why Should You be Concerned?**

- Centenarians (people living to 100 years of age) will be the norm. From 451,000 centenarians in 2015 to 3.7 million in 2050 — an _eightfold increase_. [Pew Research Center](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/04/21/worlds-centenarian-population-projected-to-grow-eightfold-by-2050/)

- Today, the average life expectancy is around 72 years; the typical person can expect to have to save for 7–10 years of retirement. Living to 100 years will require saving for decades of retirement.
- This longevity will create an even greater financial strain on the pension-fund-gap problem: from $70-trillion dollar pension gap (_today_) among the largest eight countries tp $400-trillion dollars in 2050.

Eight-fold increase in global centenarians.

**How Akropolis Envisions Solving This?**

Akropolis is introducing innovative, data-driven solutions to not only reinforce, but incentivize effective solutions to research-supported drivers (e.g., longevity) of this pension fund gap, including working past thetraditional retirement age and saving more during all working years. How do we envision a healthy savings and smart pension fund investing throughout these increased years of longevity with an Akropolis pension infrastructure?

1. Putting control of back in the hands of employees investing in pension funds by removing the reliance of third parties over time with smart contracts for increased accountability.
2. Leveraging blockchain and tokenization to create transparency of investments (i.e., allowing users to know where financial institutions are investing their pension savings).
3. Incentivizing users for investing more during defined periods, enabling auto-escalation of monthly investments, completing financial education, etc. with tokenization.
4. Creating an efficient and secure blockchain-based infrastructure for pension funds to use that will help eliminate significant administrative and technological costs.
