# Why life is getting more expensive than inflation suggests, and what that means for you  —  Part III

<img src="/images/library-img/inflation1-2-3/3.jpeg" width="100%" alt="drawing" />

In parts [1](https://wiki.akropolis.io/library/2018%20Why%20life%20is%20getting%20more%20expensive%20than%20inflation%20suggests%201/) and [2](https://wiki.akropolis.io/library/2018%20Why%20life%20is%20getting%20more%20expensive%20than%20inflation%20suggests%202/) of this post, we explained **what inflation really is**  —  and **why real-life inflation may be a lot higher than official figures suggest**. This time, we&#39;re going to look at **specific examples of goods and services** appreciating a lot faster than we think. Specifically, we&#39;ll look at _cars_, _homes_, _education_ and _clothes_, all of which have gotten **a lot** more expensive in the last decade.

First on our list are…

**Clothes**

**In the last couple of decades**, we&#39;ve seen a boom of **&quot;fast fashion&quot;** brands like **Zara**, **H&amp;M** and **Topshop**. Anecdotally, shoppers know that as recently as 5–7 years ago, it was difficult to find an item priced at **$100** in any of these brands&#39; offerings. Today, though, fast fashion price points of **$100**, **$200** and **$300** are all common.

In other words, fast fashion quickly went _from a cheap alternative to high-end brands to being fairly expensive_. And if you look at other fashion segments, you&#39;ll see [a similar change](http://nymag.com/fashion/06/spring/15735/).

**Next up, let&#39;s look at cars**.

**Cars**

**In the late 20th century US**, a car was **a staple rather than a luxury**. Anecdotally, most median-income households could buy a car **by sticking to the 20/4/10 rule** : _20% of your income on a down payment, then 10% of your income to pay for interest and insurance over 4 years._

Today, things are very different. Using the 20/4/10 rule, **a median Miami resident** has [**$13,577**](http://fortune.com/2017/06/28/car-buy-price/) to buy a car. For comparison, the average new car actually costs **$35,368**. That&#39;s a big gap, and it shows that new cars  —  heck, **all** cars  —  are now **out of reach for the median American**.

**(In other countries, where cars tend to be more expensive, things are often worse, with cars being completely out of the question for many families.)**

**Now let&#39;s move on to another important cost: that of owning or renting a home.**

**Homes**

**In much of the developed world**, homes have never been more **expensive**. A 1940 home would cost the average American family **$2,938**. Adjusted for inflation, that&#39;s **under $40,000** in today&#39;s dollars. But today, an actual U.S. home costs **well over $200,000** ; **a 500%** difference **after you adjust for inflation**. Clearly, homes are **far more** expensive than inflation numbers suggest.

A similar pattern emerges **in Europe**. In countries like **Italy**, **France** and **Spain**, the house price:disposable income ratio has gone up **by** [**50% or more in the last 2 decades**](http://www.economicsinpictures.com/2012/06/house-prices-versus-disposable-income.html). Europeans have never paid so much for homes; same as Americans.

**Last but not least, let&#39;s talk about…**

**Education**

**In the United States**, college fees have appreciated [**4x faster than the CPI**](https://www.landlordzone.co.uk/information/taking-the-heat-out-of-the-housing-market) since the **1940s**. This means that, once again, inflation figures don&#39;t capture the extent to which education has become more expensive.

**In Europe**, things are a little better. Nordic countries and welfare states like **Belgium** and **France** still offer education for relatively little money.

But in other countries, **fees** can go up very quickly (and unexpectedly). Case in point: the UK famously [**tripled**](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/mar/21/explained-triple-tuition-fees-no-extra-cash)[**university fees in 2013–2014**](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/mar/21/explained-triple-tuition-fees-no-extra-cash), and **Ireland&#39;s** university fees are currently in line with the **US&#39;s**.

In short, education is getting more expensive on both sides of the ocean — and at a far greater speed than inflation figures suggest.

And there you have it. Although official inflation figures are low, everything is getting more expensive — and fast. If you want to maintain your living standards now and in the future, there&#39;s never been a better time to start thinking ahead.
