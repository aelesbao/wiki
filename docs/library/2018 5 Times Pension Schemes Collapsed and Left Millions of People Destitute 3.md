In the first 2 parts of this 3-part series, we covered how **the USSR**, **the UK government and the administration of Prichard**, **Alabama** all left pensioners broke (or underpaid).

In this final part, we&#39;ll change things up _by looking at a historical example of pension fund failure_. We&#39;ll also cover _what happens when a private company decides (or has no choice but) to stop paying pensions_.

**4. Ancient Rome**

**Modern pensions are a new invention.** However, past cultures  —  especially warrior cultures  —  also _had pensions for soldiers_. From _Ancient Rome_&#39;s soldier-pensioners to _Napoleon_&#39;s _demi soldes_, it&#39;s never been uncommon for soldier retirees to get governmental support.

Just take **Ancient Rome**. From the 5th century BC, a soldier discharged honorably (with an _honesta missio_) was entitled to several things, one of which was **a pension**. A full pension package included money, Roman citizenship and permission to marry a Roman (_conubium_). Together, these benefits became very enticing, and encouraged an ever-growing number of young men to serve.

Unfortunately, the Roman empire eventually couldn&#39;t fund its pension obligations. Its currency devalued, inflation was high, and government pensions lost their luster. Thus collapsed the Roman national pension scheme  —  leading, some believe, to the empire&#39;s ultimate demise.

Last but not least, let&#39;s look at a different example. This case is unique, because pensioners were protected by their employer and the government… And lost their pension fund anyway. Here&#39;s how.

**5. The United Airlines Bankruptcy**

**The United States Government** has guaranteed pensions _since the 1970s_. However, the **United Airlines** bankruptcy is an excellent example that government protection isn&#39;t everything  —  even when coupled with working for a big corporation.

Here&#39;s what happened. **United Airlines** _declared bankruptcy in 2002_. The government bailed it out, but to make the numbers add up, **UA** had to default on many of its obligations.

One of the things they defaulted on was [over $9 bn of pension obligations](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/12/AR2005061201367.html). Usually, this wouldn&#39;t be possible, but the government&#39;s Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation _absorbed the obligations_, albeit at a large discount.

_What this meant, in laymen&#39;s terms, was that over 130,000 UA employees were left with as little as 50% of the money they were promised._

It didn&#39;t matter that they worked for a large corporation in a cash-rich industry. It didn&#39;t matter that the US government &quot;guarantees&quot; pensions. As with all the examples above, pensioners were left with far less than promised.

And there you have it. Now you know how 5 major pension schemes  —  from the Roman Empire&#39;s to United Airlines  —  failed, leaving millions destitute.

The question is, do you still trust your pension plan? And if not, what are you doing to make sure you and your family don&#39;t end up living in poverty once you retire?
