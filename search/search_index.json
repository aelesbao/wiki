Akropolis is a domain-specific financial protocol dedicated to the needs of the informal economy. It is designed to: enable anybody regardless of geography to quickly set up, operate and grow informal autonomous financial organisations (AFOs), e.g. digital co-ops, guilds, mutuals enable a previously impossible interoperable scalable network between them and external third parties, whereby value can be exchanged freely in a trust-minimised way (e.g. co-invest, lend/borrow, trade). reduce instances of fraud and misuse of funds What is DeFi? What is your place in DeFi ecosystem? Decentralized finance (#defi) refers to a group of financial sector-focussed startups that leverages open source software and decentralized networks to transform traditional financial products into trustless and transparent protocols that operate without unnecessary intermediaries. DeFi is by far the most promising area of blockchain application, with a number of high-quality interoperable projects promising the future of transparent, fully auditable, efficient peer-to-peer interactions, based both on existing financial primitives and creating novel ways to generate and exchange value. We are building an alternative savings infrastructure that can be tested by informal savings groups (or AFOs) in emerging markets now. What problem are you seeking to solve? The protocol is designed to enable scalability of informal member-owned organisations, that have existed for centuries globally and remain active in emerging markets, especially in Africa. This is envisaged as an alternative to challenged centralised institutions mandated with providing pensions/banking/social insurance. How do you know it is a valid problem with verified demand? The problem of insolvency of centralised pensions and social security institutions is a well documented one. Our summary of external resources is below: Library of press articles here .

Imagine, you are approaching retirement age and are counting on a healthy amount to see you through your latter years? Only to discover that after fees, haircuts and forced reductions, the money you were counting on is not there? Because your country is massively in debt and the public funds have been leveraged to pay other debts of the state. And you are not prepared? Having an alternative system that renders such outcome an impossibility by design is an \u221ex improvement to what is expected to be a status quo for many people on a 10-year timeframe. What are informal savings groups (ISG)? Why are they important? Savings groups are member-owned institutions, typically <20 members who save together and take small loans from the common savings pool or invest together and then share profits. Savings Groups are simple, transparent, autonomous and locally run . Members provide their own savings and credit services at negligible cost, while retaining earnings and investment in their own communities. Savings groups have proven to be one of the most effective, low-cost alternative mechanisms to provide basic financial services for people that have difficulties in receiving those services from traditional financial institutions. Informal savings groups and closely linked to diaspora remittances and are an existing element of most emerging markets economies. They are one of the earliest and most robust surviving forms of a de facto autonomous financial organisation. What are autonomous financial organisations (AFO)? Autonomous financial organisations is a term native to the Akropolis protocol used to denote all digital co-ops/guilds, i.e. member-owned organisations that provide financial services such as co-savings and co-investing, access to credit on flexible terms, a basic form of insurance etc. Informal Savings Groups is a real-world form of an AFO. What services are planned to be available for AFOs? Savings accounts, co-investment inside the network, access to low-cost easily accessible credit inside the network, social insurance. Why focus on emerging markets? Real-world use case : mass adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology will first take place in areas with poorly developed legacy financial infrastructure, where cryptocurrency adds real value and is a superior alternative to currently available options. Weak legacy financial infrastructure : dominance of mobile money (e.g. mPesa) for over a decade; relatively advanced digital financial infrastructure. Multi-billion-dollar total addressable market : Informal savings groups hold hundreds of billions of US$, with remittances between diaspora/immigrant communities reaching US$240 bn YoY . Existing behavioural patterns and product-market fit : Without imposing new behavioural patterns on users who have already been operating like this for years, we help informal savings circle leapfrog to member-owned banks by making them scaleable, fraud-proof, and geography-agnostic using the blockchain technology. We see informal economy in Africa, esp. Kenya as an excellent market to verify assumptions and get real user feedback that will help the protocol evolve into a tool for developed markets based on our 10-year outlook (failure of centralised pension funds, failure of depositor protection schemes, cash controls, etc.), which if correct will spawn a new wave of digital member-owned financial organisations as safer, more trustworthy alternatives. Technology Why is there a need to use blockchain and what does it uniquely enable that wouldn\u2019t otherwise be possible? A stable financial system relies on trust in the state and private sector financial institutions. In most developed markets, that trust has been lost. Blockchain technology uniquely enables alternative member-owned financial institutions by providing the following: trust-minimised exchange of value between the parties that do not know or trust each other shared immutable on-chain financial accounting prevents fraud and misuse of funds fully transparent and auditable smart contracts ensure provable solvency. Will you be building your own blockchain? No, we are not. Designed as a blockchain-agnostic protocol, Akropolis is currently being implemented on Ethereum, the next iteration will be built using Polkadot , with active R&D underway. What is the risk of your solution being affected by Ethereum scalability issues? At the protocol level, speed and immediately finality are not as relevant as being able to guarantee fraud-resistant accounting and solve for trust-minimised exchanges of value between remote parties. Therefore, scalability is not a critical dependency on our roadmap. What are the building blocks of Akropolis protocol? C2FC DCDM Identity Management module Accounting module Reputation module What is C2FC? Commitments to Future Cashflows (or C2FC) \u2013 a financial primitive that represents a digital right to operate with future cashflow that will arrive in any form to any Ethereum address (now it works in Ethereum, but could be implemented in any blockchain)within a given time frame. Simply put, it looks like a relay: a C2FC issuer must receive payment within this specified period, but those payments are fully or partially forwarded to the C2FC token holder\u2019s address. Therefore, the future cashflow of any individual, company or service takes the form of a measurable digital unit that can be easily exchanged, traded or used as collateral. What is Digital Community Decision Making (DCDM)? AFOs work as decentralised autonomous organisations. The governance inside each AFO is different from a protocol governance as only AFO members are able to make decisions thus there is no need for the internal token in every autonomous financial organisation. The Digital Community Decision Making (DCDM) Framework provides decision support for Autonomous Financial Organisations. The core DCDM API supports a number of base level commands, like registration of new Autonomous Financial Organisation, making changes to its constitution etc. What is Identity Management Module (IM)? IMS is analogous to Ethereum Naming service, which keep the following records: Registry of all users of the protocol and links to user\u2019s external personal data providers, e.g. hash with a document copy or IPFS link List of all created AFOs List of all created AFO members Do you provide a credit scoring system? No. We do not centrally store protocol user data or provide scoring and risk assessment within the protocol. Any third-party can access pseudo-anonymised transactions on-chain and assess the risk on their own or use third-party data to assess the risk. Off-chain information may be elected to be shared by AFOs in order to get access to competitively-priced credit from external capital providers. As a result, a third-party may combine various opt-in data sources to create an alternative credit scoring system. When Ethereum anonymisation and gas-effective zk-snarks solution is created, we will seek to apply it to the protocol. We continue monitoring the ecosystem, e.g. Aztec protocol. Incentive Design & Token Utility Token Functionality and Use by Stakeholder Type Token functionality and use is modeled on MakerDAO and is designed to ensure that all participants, acting in their own self-interests are motivated to (a) maximize the value captured through and by the network; and (b) maintain sustainable network growth. Please note that a party may combine roles for a greater impact within the network. Token holder type: AFO (Borrowers) Economic Objectives: Secure access to well-priced easily available credit Maximize availability of credit and its price Maximise duration/term of the credit lines How does a token help them achieve it? Referral incentives: Incentivised to grow the network through referring other AFOs (or encouraging other AFOs to be moved/set up on our network), as the greater the volume of successfully repaid credit, the greater is the reputational value of the system and the lower the cost of credit; Ability to attract greater volume of credit is proportional to the overall volume of value captured by the system, which is maximized through growth in number of AFOs and in their own size. This is important as fractional-reserve banking approach is not available or applicable to non-bank AFOs. The above increases the volume of staken tokens, thus reducing the token circulating supply Token holder type: Network Keepers Economic Objectives: Profit-seeking agents rewarded for correct risk assessment by receiving a network stability fee Maximize stability fee How does a token help them achieve it? Staking and governance function is enabled by holding the token which provides both an incentive and a skin in the game to facilitate sustainable network growth. Network keepers act as underwriters of the AFO default risk. They are being rewarded for correct default risk prediction through a % of the Capital Provider income in respect of that AFO Their stake is burnt in the event of AFO default Incentivized to create a public, data-rich rep or credit scoring system to their return, which can only be done through network growth Token holder type: Capital Providers (Lenders) Economic Objectives: To grant a loans with best risk/profit ratio To be protected from AFO\u2019s fraud and defaults on debts by network mechanisms How does a token help them achieve it? The token staking approach creates a collective scoring system that helps Capital Providers to make correct decisions and decreases credit risk The governance approach allows Capital Providers to affect the network variables, that are decisive to their profit (such as stability fee and intra-network rate(analogous to the well-known LIBOR) Why is there a need to use own token and what does it uniquely enable that wouldn\u2019t otherwise be possible? Is your token utility or security? Our token is classified as a Network Token or Governance Token. It provides functionality within the Akropolis network and can act as a market maker mechanism, can be used to control access to liquidity, provide governance functionality, and/or contribute capital to the network. As such, the token is an essential element of the internal economy and cannot be replaced by an external stablecoin as token stakes and governance approach required to be managed only by using a token, which value is connected to the current network and not tied to other projects/networks. How are you going to prevent Sybil Attacks? Sybil attack risk is mitigated by: crypto-economic incentive mechanism: staking and stability fee social reputation Who is your target audience?

Our scheme is generalised to allow any cryptocurrency to be used with any identifier. We bring simplicity and familiar UX to crypto by allowing people to send and receive crypto (Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens, at this stage!) using just their mobile number All you need to send crypto to a friend is her mobile number No need to share your ethereum address over insecure channels like messengers/email/SMS. It\u2019s quick, as easy as Venmo , safe and private (you hold the keys) Problem In order to make a payment over a decentralized network, the user needs to know the recipient\u2019s public key. A public key is a notoriously long set of numbers and letters. It is easy to make a mistake, and copy-pasting isn\u2019t always safe if your device is compromised. As a result, the UX is not intuitive and continues to present a serious hurdle to the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. There are notable teams working on addressing that - shoutout to Austin Griffith from BurnerWallet , Ric from Balance.io and Viktor from TrustWallet . What we are proposing below is our solution that can be integrated with the ecosystem wallets, exchanges and dApps to expand their offering and UX. Solution We introduce a NuCypher-based cryptographic scheme, which allows users to send ETH and ERC-20 tokens to a mobile number instead of the recipient\u2019s public key. Our solution has the following features: Convenient and familiar UX : no cognitive burden on users User privacy and self-sovereignty : user controls who can know her Ethereum address. User can only receive payments from pre-approved parties, however their number is uncapped. Generalised and scalable : can be used across many identifiers and any cryptocurrencies any other identifier, e.g. email ID, Whatsapp ID, Telegram ID, Signal ID, WeChat ID, etc. This scheme can be extended to include any cryptocurrency. How it works Register Set settings of access to ethereum address to your friends from the contact list Send tokens and ethereum using a phone number instead of ethereum address. Target Client Base (lib) Wallets and dApp browsers ( Trust wallet , Balance , imToken , etc.) Exchanges ( Binance , Coinbase , Kraken , etc.) dApps ( OpenSea , CryptoKitties , Decentraland , etc.). Tech design A) Database: (KMS-like (Key Management System), could be centralized or decentralized): stores a pair of phone number\u2019s hash and NuCypher public key. B) Storage (could be centralized or decentralized): keeps users' encrypted messages with private information: ethereum address, first name and last name (or nickname). Let\u2019s consider our usual Bob and Alice. 1) When registering Alice performs the following actions: a. encrypts the data (message w/ ethereum address, first name/last name) with its private key and puts it in Storage b. sends its NuCypher public key to Database. 2) Alice sends API request to Database and gets Bob's NuCypher public key. 3) Alice creates a re-encryption key (rekey) >> NuCypher nodes re-encrypt Alice\u2019s data >> Alice puts TreasureMap in Storage. Now Bob can decipher Alice\u2019s data by his private NuCypher key. Please note that actions 2 and 3 can be performed for any number of friends from Alice\u2019s contact list. Then Bob wants to send ETH or ERC-20 tokens to Alice. 4) Bob gets TreasureMap from Storage. 5) Bob deciphers Alice\u2019s data. Now Bob knows Alice\u2019s ethereum address. 6) The application generates a transaction for Alice with the ethereum address from the message as a payee. Thus, users can send each other ETH/ERC-20 using just a mobile number of any other identifier, e.g. email ID, Whatsapp ID, Telegram ID, Signal ID, WeChat ID, etc. This scheme can be extended to include any cryptocurrency. Why NuCypher NuCypher is a decentralized KMS provider based on homomorphic cryptography. Using NuCypher we can achieve a secure transmission of address data and effect transfers between the two parties without disclosing the addresses themselves, thus delivering robust partial anonymisation of transactions. A complete anonymisation can be achieved using ZK-Snarks, Schnorr signatures or ring signatures however this work is outside of the timeframe allowed for this project and may be included in further iterations. As a result, what we get is cryptographically secure solution that guarantees that access to address and phone number data cannot be obtained illegally or on authorities\u2019 demand without the explicit consent of the user. Video Walkthrough Force Majeure Unfortunately, after designing architecture of our product, our lead blockchain developer had to drop out of the work schedule due to a health emergency, therefore we can only demonstrate a pre-recorded prototype.

Findings from the commission\u200a \u2014 \u200aestablished last December by organisations including the Institute of Economic Affairs and the Institute of Directors\u200a \u2014 \u200asuggested the government had used artificially high discount rates to report unfunded liabilities and a different rate to calculate employer and employee contributions, which appeared to lower the cost of providing public sector pensions. (See earlier IPE article: UK roundup: ONS and Public Sector Pensions Commission ) The report said the government employed a discount rate based on AA-rated corporate bonds instead of index-linked gilts to calculate liabilities, while public sector employers and employees are \"not charged the full current service costs of the liabilities the pension schemes are taking on each year\". It said a \"completely different discount rate\" chosen by the government had been used to compute these. As a result, the commission argued that both employers and employees undervalue the scheme because although they are paying combined contributions of around 20% of salary, the true value based on index-linked gilts is closer to 40% of salary, or even 30% based on long-term gilt returns. It estimated that, in 2010\u201311, using the government's methodology for calculating the annual service cost, these pensions would cost \u00a318.5bn (\u20ac22.2bn), of which \u00a34.5bn would come from the Treasury, or the taxpayer. But the commission said this was an inaccurate measure of the cost, that the figure was closer to \u00a335bn a year and that this is what employers and employees should be paying. Peter Tompkins, fellow of the institute of actuaries and chairman of the commission, said: \"It is a matter both of justice and good economics that public sector employees and employers should bear the full cost of their pension provision as it accrues. \"So long as those contributions are sufficient to pay the public sector pensions of today, the cash flows in and out steadily and in balance. \"Of late, however, the amount the Treasury has to pay to top pensions up has risen and will rise still further into the future. \"Like an unstable Ponzi scheme, it will only work if tomorrow's generations of new members and taxpayers are able to stomach a higher cost to pay tomorrow for the unfunded promises being made today.\" Tompkins added: \"No one change on its own will be enough to control costs if you want to bring costs down to the 20% level people have in mind, rather than a 40% we believe we have shown they are actually costing.\" The commission outlined a number of potential reforms to try and improve transparency and reduce the cost of the public sector pensions to the taxpayer, such as: A reformed defined benefit option to bring costs down to 20% of salary Reducing the accrual rate to 1/80th or switching to a career average scheme could save \u00a310bn a year Increasing pension age to 65 for all members, which would save \u00a35bn a year Reducing index-linking of pensions from Retail Price Inflation (RPI) to Consumer Price Inflation (CPI), which would save 10% of the costs Increasing employer contributions by 2 percentage points, raising \u00a32bn a year Other possibilities considered by the commission included moving to a defined contribution or a hybrid scheme, although the report noted each option for reform had its pros and cons. Tompkins added: \"As Greece has been experiencing, increases to retirement ages or cuts in benefits are not popular at the best of times, but implementing them as part of a package of crisis cuts is the least palatable option of all. \"It is essential reforms be conducted early in a measured way rather than waiting until we have a crisis.\" Tompkins repeatedly said he believed existing benefits should be \"sacrosanct\". Of all reform proposals, he said contribution increases were the easiest to put forward. \"It can be a little bit painful because employees are going to have to pay more, as are employers,\" he said, adding that this was the way the Irish government had successfully tackled the problem. He was critical of the government's proposal to link public-sector pensions to CPI as of next year, saying: \"If you've promised people an RPI-linked pension for the work they've done until now, you should be delivering that.\" The commission calculated that the shift to CPI-linked pensions would gradually reduce the overall public-sector liability from \u00a31.28trn to \u00a31.1trn. Other proposals put forward recently included an upper limit on public-sector pensions, setting a cap at \u00a350,000 a year.

A state-funded pension is clearly a claim on future taxpayers. A funded plan, whether final salary/defined benefit or defined contribution, invests in government bonds (a different claim on future taxpayers), equities and corporate bonds (claims on future profits, which are generated by future workers) or property (claims on future rents, generated by future workers). To keep going, then, any pension scheme needs a new batch of workers. Each generation need not necessarily be larger than the last but they need to be more productive. Imagine, in extremis, that the people of America or Britain produced only one surving descendant. This child might race around like a one-armed paperhanger, but could not possibly sustain the stock and bond markets on his or her own. Yes, in theory, citizens of one country could amass pension claims in the form of overseas assets (and thus have claims on foreign workers). But that would only work in the context of years of current account surpluses, which has not been the case in most of the developed world. What differentiates different pension schemes is the clarity of the claims being made, and the costs involved. In a classic DB scheme, the claims of the worker are very clear; a proportion of his or her final salary, which may or may not be inflation-linked. The lack of clarity is on the cost side; employers, particularly in the public sector, have underestimated the cost, which has been inflated by improved longevity and lower-than-expected investment returns. In a classic DC scheme, the cost to the employers is clear but the benefit to the worker is not; in fact the outcome is a bit of a lottery . A collective DC scheme tries to finagle this problem by giving workers a claim, but a claim that can be reduced if the assets fall short of tareget. As John Ralfe points out in FTFM , this creates some complex intergenerational issues, such as whether workers have the right to withdraw their assets. I don't think he's right to call them \"Ponzi cons\" as those are outright frauds, and that is not really the case. In a column three years ago , I tried to spell out the distinction between a pyramid and a Ponzi. But this is all about trade-offs between costs and benefits; there is no perfect answer.

In a classic DC scheme, the cost to the employers is clear but the benefit to the worker is not; in fact the outcome is a bit of a lottery . A collective DC scheme tries to finagle this problem by giving workers a claim, but a claim that can be reduced if the assets fall short of tareget. As John Ralfe points out in FTFM , this creates some complex intergenerational issues, such as whether workers have the right to withdraw their assets. I don't think he's right to call them \"Ponzi cons\" as those are outright frauds, and that is not really the case. In a column three years ago , I tried to spell out the distinction between a pyramid and a Ponzi. But this is all about trade-offs between costs and benefits; there is no perfect answer.

The internet began implementation in 1983. The first smartphone was launched in 1992\u201315 years before the first iPhone drove us all into a frenzy. Following slow starts, these innovations became 'disruptive technologies' that fundamentally changed all aspects of the world around us, including within the pensions industry. And now another emerging technology is expected to have just as much of an impact: Blockchain. About blockchain Blockchain is a \"game changer\" according to Protiviti managing director, IT security and privacy, Ryan Rubin.\"A disruptive technology that fundamentally calls into question many of the industry structures that have been in place for decades, if not centuries.\" Blockchain technology is a new way to process financial transactions. While traditionally these transactions required the use of 'middlemen' to verify the transaction securely (custodian houses and the London Stock Exchange are two such 'middlemen' for example), blockchain removes the need for these intermediaries. The result is transactions can be completed more swiftly and with less 'processes' to go through, which can therefore lower costs. To achieve this, the digital record of a financial transaction is encrypted into a 'block'. A number of blockchain users' computers (as independent entities known as 'blockchain miners') then verify if it is a genuine transaction. If they all approve the transaction the money will be passed from A to B. The 'block' representing that transaction is then bound onto the 'chain' that records the movement of that money using algorithms\u200a\u2014\u200athus creating a continuous, linked list of transactions that provides a secure and unchangeable history of electronic transactions, Equiniti director Paul Sturgess says. Or, to put it simply, EY director Jason Whyte compares it to the old mobile phone game Snake , where every time the snake 'ate' a block on screen, the block got added onto the end of the snake. The details of each transaction/ block are not stored, only the fact that the transaction happened, along with the unique 'digital signature' of that transaction/block, which cannot be converted back into its original form. \"If the original data was altered it would produce a different digital signature that would alert the network to the mismatch,\" Gowling director Liz Wood explains. To put a visual slant on it, imagine someone holding a picture of themselves holding a picture of themselves holding a picture of themselves etc\u200a\u2014\u200aeach block has this 'picture' of all the previous transactions, and the further along the chain, the more repetitions of the 'picture' each block would have. Therefore any tampering would stand out throughout the chain. Also, as the data is distributed to so many computers, it should be much harder for hackers to attack it compared to traditional financial transaction processes. Blockchain's use of multiple peer devices to authorise every transaction means \"it quite simply can't be overridden by one party attempting to manipulate records\", Hames states. Adding to the blockchain's security is the element of tracking and transparency. As there are no 'middlemen' recording the movement of money, the blockchains showing the financial transactions are instead available for everybody to view, via a distributed (or 'shared') ledger. IFDS director of innovation Phil Goffin adds that blockchain provides both investors and financial institutions with the same industry-standard cryptography controls to enable secure communications. This removes trust issues such as identity theft, thus enabling parties to maintain shared ledgers of their economic affairs, he explains. Financial beginnings Blockchain technology was first conceived in 2008 and was implemented in 2009 to be used with the online-only currency (which is a currency that has no gold or silver standard attached to it, no government backing, and is only worth as much as people are prepared to trade for it, also known as a 'cryptocurrency') Bitcoin. So far, the amount of money moved using blockchain amounts to just 0.025 per cent of global GDP, or $20 billion, according to the World Economic Forum. But while the amount is currently small, this is set to grow rapidly, particularly as the financial services industry has started to explore blockchain's potential. There are currently a number of blockchain trials taking place within the financial service industry, such as R3 Cev, which is a consortium of over 40 banks developing the settlement of securities using blockchain and setl.io, a group that is developing an institutional payment solution for the UK banking system. The Bank of England is also leading a trial to replace the Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS), which sits at the heart of the UK banking system. Also, the Financial Conduct Authority said that it was considering approving a \"small but significant number of firms\", Alpha FMC principal Olivia Vinden says. \"A group of seven banks, including Santander, CIBC and UniCredit were amongst the first financial institutions to move real money across borders using blockchain-based technology,\" she adds. Financial services firms embracing this technology may seem strange, as it has the potential to be an existential risk to entire sections within the industry. \"For some financial companies, blockchain strikes at the heart of your business, if your business model is in managing those assets for people who want to trade them,\" Whyte says. \"But then the question is if you think this is going to cannibalise your industry, are you better to cannibalise it first and build a new business model around it or wait for it to happen to you?\" Vinden agrees that blockchain could represent a risk to those parts of the financial industry that support clearing, settlement and safekeeping. \"However, the possibility to reduce costs as a result of this technology should be seen as an opportunity, rather than a threat,\" she states. For instance, Capita divisional head of marketing and research Robin Hames thinks it could quite easily take off in emerging economies where the financial infrastructure is less developed and less ingrained, so can more easily be overhauled. \"It's the 'advanced' economies themselves in catch up, ironically,\" he adds. Asset management is expected to be the first aspect of the financial services sector to take this opportunity and implement blockchain. Alternative assets in particular are normally quite illiquid, but blockchain could help turn them into more tradeable assets, Whyte predicts. Pensions' explorations So it is not surprising that the financial services sector is among the first to see if the benefits of blockchain can be utilised beyond the movement of online currencies. But what may be more surprising is that its potential within pensions is already being explored. Dutch pensions manager APG recently announced that it has earmarked a significant part of its innovation budget for the coming years for working alongside other companies to explore the practical applications of blockchain. The California Public Employees' Retirement Systems (CalPERS), the largest public pension fund in the US, has also discussed the possibility of investing in blockchain technology, while reports have emerged that the Chinese government will soon start using blockchain technology to process social security payments. Even the UK's Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is in the process of a three- to six-month blockchain trial, which began in May this year, with up to 24 participants. This is conducted by a private sector company, that handles the claimant's data independently from government. \"This is a small scale, voluntary trial. There are no restrictions or limits on how welfare payments are spent for those involved in the trial and all personal information is removed before the data reaches DWP,\" its spokesperson states. Industry uses Within the pensions industry itself, people are beginning to consider the benefits blockchain could provide. According to BTL Group founder and CEO Guy Halford-Thompson, \"for industries, such as pensions, which have suffered from a lack of transparency in the past, there is a huge opportunity to transform the industry with a small amount of investment in blockchain technology\". State Street head of UK pensions and banks, asset owner solutions, Andy Todd thinks it will initially impact the most 'inefficient' areas of the pensions industry, such as those that are manual, require a lot of stakeholders to engage, align and sign-off, or have intermediaries that add cost to the system. Certainly smoothing the many layers within the pensions industry generally could be beneficial to savers. Currently, the pension fund member is connected to a set of underlying assets via pension fund managers, asset managers, brokers and investment funds. Blockchain technology offers the prospect of sweeping away a lot of this complexity and frictional cost, Rubin says. \"For example, how long does it currently take the industry to undertake a pension fund transfer? Typically several months. To a customer who is already getting used to the fact that they can transfer money reliably between bank accounts now in a matter of minutes via Faster Payments, the length of this delay is difficult for the industry to explain. Blockchain technology could bring this time down to a matter of minutes if implemented correctly,\" he explains. The greater transparency of ownership of pension fund assets could make well-performing funds more attractive to buyers, therefore helping generate better investment decisions overall, Rubin adds. Blockchain technology could also instigate the use of 'smart contracts', where the technology has rules built in to automate simple transactions when certain conditions are met (such as a market fluctuation or a pension saver reaching a certain age). This would offer greater transparency on payments/fees/ allocation of funds and shorten the time taken to complete transactions. Blockchain's ability to 'link' financial transactions together could also be a valuable mechanism for recording an individual's pension savings. \"Instead of having a new pension every time I go to a new employer, the record of my pension and the contributions paid in may be added to my one blockchain, despite the different employers throughout my working life paying into my pension. And as it cannot be modified, we will always know that it is an accurate record,\" Whyte says. Blockchain could then also have a role in the secondary annuity market where initial and ultimate beneficiaries will change over time, Sturgess adds. It is important to note that blockchain technology has the potential for recording and linking any data, not just financial, meaning its uses within the pensions industry could extend beyond finance to administration. For instance, blockchain could be used to improve upon pensions communications. If a member had several pots with various providers, that information could be pooled into a blockchain so as to form an overall position of the member's pensions savings, Wood states. The industry is currently in the process of implementing a pensions dashboard to enable people to see all their savings in one place, so it would not be surprising if this area was an early adopter of blockchain within the pensions industry, Hames adds. Documents such as member records, scheme documents, service contracts and accounts could be kept and updated through blockchain. All parties would be able to view the same information, so the problem of version control would disappear, Pensions Administration Standards Association chairman Margaret Snowdon says. Blockchain may become a powerful weapon against pension liberation fraud, due to the increased transparency it provides. Data could also be included within the blockchain to confirm whether advice has been taken before the money is transferred to the saver, Snowdon adds. \"From a financial advice perspective it would be great to be able to hand over an accurate record of a pensions holdings and have a financial adviser view that blockchain very rapidly to get a view of what they have got and might need,\" Whyte says. He adds that \"you can imagine the government being quite interested in blockchain for tax records\". Hames agrees that it would be \"tremendously useful\" for regulators and auditors who struggle with reconciliation activities, which could be done automatically. \"A very prescient example would be the current GMP reconciliation requirements, which will exorcise the minds and time of administrators and trustees alike for the next couple of years,\" he says. \"Imagine how less painful, or frankly unnecessary, this work would be had a shared, validated ledger existed.\" Risks So already the industry is imagining blockchain technology having a wide number of benefits for the sector. Imagination is a wonderful thing. But could the reality be not so pretty? Despite blockchain still being a new technology, and the security it provides much heralded, it has already been subject to hacks. For instance, recent attacks on digital currency exchanges DAO and Bitfinex saw over $50 million taken. Re Business Blockchain author William Mougayar states that while security is an inherent feature of blockchains, a blockchain application could be badly written and have security holes, \"just as a web application could have security weaknesses too\". Breaches so far seem to be exploiting the trouble users have protecting their online currency (as they are generally stored in digital files) instead of the distributed ledger system of blockchains itself being compromised. But the whole 'newness' of the technology could also be an issue. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, which is a group of US regulators, has already warned that \"operational vulnerabilities [with blockchain] may not become apparent until they are deployed at scale\". A teething problem that has already occurred, Whyte notes, is when two transactions happen at roughly the same time, which can result in a short period of time where a blockchain has two chains until the 'real' chain is established. Another issue is that the technology is changing very quickly. For instance, Accenture has just taken out a controversial patent on a technology that lets them edit a blockchain. A key part of blockchain's security is that it cannot be tampered with, but the argument for this patent is that it would provide a cleaner way to undo a mistake, such as if someone made a 'fat finger trade' and added an extra '0' onto a transaction, Whyte explains. The evolving nature of the new technology also generates a risk around standardisation and cooperation. \"As the technology is still evolving it is possible that we could end up with a VHS versus Betamax situation,\" Sturgess warns, \"where both technologies were technically excellent for the purpose, but ultimately it was disagreement regarding standards and licenses that allowed VHS to dominate the market.\" Reluctance There is also a risk that the pensions industry itself may be reluctant to utilise blockchain technology. As is often the case with technology advances, legacy systems are the biggest barrier to implementation. It really required online banking to take hold before many in pensions were prepared to embrace the digital channel, Hames states. \"And let's be honest, there are still plenty of schemes that are well behind the online curve, let alone exploring blockchain,\" he adds. To counter this, Snowdon recommends the creation of a technology forum for the pensions industry. But in the meantime, it seems unlikely the pensions industry would want to risk putting pension fund members savings in cutting-edge technology. While the technology is still being developed and is not yet being widely used by banks, a court may not look favourably on a trustee who invested in a company using blockchain if this resulted in the loss of pension scheme money, Wood warns. And while blockchain may have benefits for the pensions sector, and could reduce some inefficiency, it will not be a panacea to all the industry's problems. For instance, it will not provide insight as to where money should be invested to achieve positive returns with low volatility. It will not stop human error, such the wrong amounts being put into the system. And it will not address the need for people save more for retirement and engage with those savings. Overhype? So as it is certainly not a 'cure all', does that mean blockchain technology is overhyped? \"It is approaching the peak of Gartner's Hype Curve,\" Sturgess states, \"and as such will soon drop into the wonderfully-named 'trough of disillusionment', at which point many early-stage companies are likely to fail and the market will become frustrated by the lack of useable products and tangible benefits. The technology companies will then start to consolidate and prepare for mainstream adoption as clearer business use cases start to emerge.\" It has to be remembered that the technology is still very new. Currently, blockchain is being compared to the internet in the 1990s, where the first internet sites looked and behaved more like traditional shops until people became used to the new technology and its applications. As it still early days for the technology, no doubt blockchain will see a number of false starts. But when considering if and when blockchain will have an impact on the pension sector, it is worth mulling over the words of a man at the heart of many technological innovations\u200a\u2014\u200aBill Gates. He has stated: \"We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next 10. Don't let yourself be lulled into inaction.\" Written by Laura Blows [Download the PDF here ] For additional information about Akropolis, please reach out to team@akropolis.io .","title":"New kid on the block"},{"location":"library/2016 New kid on the block/#new-kid-on-the-block","text":"The first computer was created back in 1946.

Breaches so far seem to be exploiting the trouble users have protecting their online currency (as they are generally stored in digital files) instead of the distributed ledger system of blockchains itself being compromised. But the whole 'newness' of the technology could also be an issue. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, which is a group of US regulators, has already warned that \"operational vulnerabilities [with blockchain] may not become apparent until they are deployed at scale\". A teething problem that has already occurred, Whyte notes, is when two transactions happen at roughly the same time, which can result in a short period of time where a blockchain has two chains until the 'real' chain is established. Another issue is that the technology is changing very quickly. For instance, Accenture has just taken out a controversial patent on a technology that lets them edit a blockchain. A key part of blockchain's security is that it cannot be tampered with, but the argument for this patent is that it would provide a cleaner way to undo a mistake, such as if someone made a 'fat finger trade' and added an extra '0' onto a transaction, Whyte explains. The evolving nature of the new technology also generates a risk around standardisation and cooperation. \"As the technology is still evolving it is possible that we could end up with a VHS versus Betamax situation,\" Sturgess warns, \"where both technologies were technically excellent for the purpose, but ultimately it was disagreement regarding standards and licenses that allowed VHS to dominate the market.\"","title":"Risks"},{"location":"library/2016 New kid on the block/#reluctance","text":"There is also a risk that the pensions industry itself may be reluctant to utilise blockchain technology. As is often the case with technology advances, legacy systems are the biggest barrier to implementation. It really required online banking to take hold before many in pensions were prepared to embrace the digital channel, Hames states. \"And let's be honest, there are still plenty of schemes that are well behind the online curve, let alone exploring blockchain,\" he adds. To counter this, Snowdon recommends the creation of a technology forum for the pensions industry. But in the meantime, it seems unlikely the pensions industry would want to risk putting pension fund members savings in cutting-edge technology. While the technology is still being developed and is not yet being widely used by banks, a court may not look favourably on a trustee who invested in a company using blockchain if this resulted in the loss of pension scheme money, Wood warns. And while blockchain may have benefits for the pensions sector, and could reduce some inefficiency, it will not be a panacea to all the industry's problems. For instance, it will not provide insight as to where money should be invested to achieve positive returns with low volatility. It will not stop human error, such the wrong amounts being put into the system. And it will not address the need for people save more for retirement and engage with those savings.","title":"Reluctance"},{"location":"library/2016 New kid on the block/#overhype","text":"So as it is certainly not a 'cure all', does that mean blockchain technology is overhyped? \"It is approaching the peak of Gartner's Hype Curve,\" Sturgess states, \"and as such will soon drop into the wonderfully-named 'trough of disillusionment', at which point many early-stage companies are likely to fail and the market will become frustrated by the lack of useable products and tangible benefits. The technology companies will then start to consolidate and prepare for mainstream adoption as clearer business use cases start to emerge.\" It has to be remembered that the technology is still very new. Currently, blockchain is being compared to the internet in the 1990s, where the first internet sites looked and behaved more like traditional shops until people became used to the new technology and its applications. As it still early days for the technology, no doubt blockchain will see a number of false starts. But when considering if and when blockchain will have an impact on the pension sector, it is worth mulling over the words of a man at the heart of many technological innovations\u200a\u2014\u200aBill Gates.

Not surprisingly, this study only served to confirm many of the rather alarming trends surrounding public pension ponzi's that we discuss on a regular basis. Starting with a high-level status update, Milliman figures the largest 100 public pensions were roughly just as underfunded on June 30, 2017 as they were on June 30, 2016\u2026 not an encouraging development given that the S&P 500 surged 15% over that same period. This 2017 report is based on information that was reported by the plan sponsors at their last fiscal year ends\u200a\u2014\u200aJune 30, 2016 is the measurement date for most of the plans in our 2017 study. At that time, plan assets were still feeling the effects of market downturns in 2014\u20132015 and 2015\u20132016. Total plan assets as of the last fiscal year ends stood at $3.19 trillion, down from $3.24 trillion as of the prior fiscal year ends (generally June 30, 2015). However, market performance since the last fiscal year ends has been strong, and we estimate that aggregate plan assets have jumped to $3.44 trillion as of June 30, 2017. We estimate that the plans experienced a median annualized return on assets of 11.49% in the period between their fiscal year ends and June 30, 2017. The Total Pension Liability reported at the last fiscal year ends totaled $4.72 trillion, up from $4.43 trillion as of the prior fiscal year ends. We estimate that the Total Pension Liability has increased to $4.87 trillion as of June 30, 2017. The aggregate underfunding as of the last fiscal year ends stood at $1.53 trillion, but we estimate that the underfunding has narrowed to $1.43 trillion as of June 30, 2017. Source: ZeroHedge \u200b Meanwhile, 32% of the top 100 plans were less than 60% funded. Source: ZeroHedge \u200b Of course, the discussion gets far more interesting when Milliman analyzes the prevailing discount rates used by public pensions compared to independent analyses of where those discount rates should be set. As our readers are well aware, we've long argued that public pension funds essentially hide their true funding status by simply choosing artificially high discount rates for future liabilities thus making their present values appear lower than they actually are. It's a clever scam but one that can only persist until the ponzi runs out of cash. As Milliman notes, the median expected return of the 100 largest public pension funds in the U.S. is somewhere around 5.9% based on the asset allocations of those funds. Source: ZeroHedge \u200b Source: ZeroHedge So, what does that mean? Well, Milliman figures that overstating a fund's discount rate by just 1% artificially reduces it's benefit liability by up to 15%. Therefore, given that the aggregate liabilities of the top 100 funds are roughly $5 trillion, each 1% adds about $750 billion in liabilities. A relatively small change in the discount rate can have a significant impact on the Total Pension Liability. How big that impact is depends on the makeup of the plan's membership: a less \"mature\" plan with more active members than retirees typically has a higher sensitivity to interest rate changes than a more mature plan with a bigger retiree population. Other factors, such as automatic cost of living features, also come into play in determining a plan's sensitivity. Using a discount rate that is loo basis points higher or lower than the independently determined investment return assumption moves the aggregate recalibrated Total Pension Liability by anywhere from 8% to 15% (see Figure 13).

Coomer used to work at the McDonnell Douglas plant in Tulsa before it closed in 1994. He and many of his co-workers could never replace their lost pension benefits and face financial struggles in their old age. (Nick Oxford for The Washington Post) Source: The Washington Post \u200b TULSA\u200a \u2014 Tom Coomer has retired twice: once when he was 65, and then several years ago. Each time he realized that with just a Social Security check, \"You can hardly make it these days.\" So here he is at 79, working full-time at Walmart. During each eight-hour shift, he stands at the store entrance greeting customers, telling a joke and fetching a \"buggy.\" Or he is stationed at the exit, checking receipts and the shoppers that trip the theft alarm. \"As long as I sit down for about 10 minutes every hour or two, I'm fine,\" he said during a break. Diagnosed with spinal stenosis in his back, he recently forwarded a doctor's note to managers. \"They got me a stool.\" The way major U.S. companies provide for retiring workers has been shifting for about three decades, with more dropping traditional pensions every year. The first full generation of workers to retire since this turn offers a sobering preview of a labor force more and more dependent on their own savings for retirement. Years ago, Coomer and his co-workers at the Tulsa plant of McDonnell Douglas, the famed airplane maker, were enrolled in the company pension, but in 1994, with an eye toward cutting retirement costs, the company closed the plant. Now, The Washington Post found in a review of those 998 workers, that even though most of them found new jobs, they could never replace their lost pension benefits and many are facing financial struggles in their old age: 1 in 7 has in their retirement years filed for bankruptcy, faced liens for delinquent bills, or both, according to public records. Those affected are buried by debts incurred for credit cards, used cars, health care and sometimes, the college educations of their children. Some have lost their homes. And for many of them, even as they reach beyond 70, real retirement is elusive. Although they worked for decades at McDonnell Douglas, many of the septuagenarians are still working, some full-time.

They really caught on in the mid-20th century, but today, except among government employers, the traditional pension seems destined to be an artifact of U.S. labor history. The first ones offered by a private company were those handed out by American Express, back when it was a stagecoach delivery service. That was in 1875. The idea didn't exactly spread like wildfire, but under union pressure in the middle of the last century, many companies adopted a plan. By the 1980s, the trend had profoundly reshaped retirement for Americans, with a large majority of full-time workers at medium and large companies getting traditional pension coverage, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Then corporate America changed: Union membership waned. Executive boards, under pressure from financial raiders, focused more intently on maximizing stock prices. And Americans lived longer, making a pension much more expensive to provide. In 1950, a 65-year-old man could be expected to reach age 78, on average. Today, that \u00ad65-year-old is expected to live beyond 84. The extended life expectancy means pension plans must pay out substantially longer than they once did. Exactly what led corporate America away from pensions is a matter of debate among scholars, but there is little question that they seem destined for extinction, at least in the private sector. Even as late as the early 1990s, about 60 percent of full-time workers at medium and large companies had pension coverage, according to the government figures. But today, only about 24 percent of workers at midsize and large companies have pension coverage, according to the data, and that number is expected to continue to fall as older workers exit the workforce. In place of pensions, companies and investment advisers urge employees to open retirement accounts. The basic idea is workers will manage their own retirement funds, sometimes with a little help from their employers, sometimes not. Once they reach retirement age, those accounts are supposed to supplement whatever Social Security might pay. (Today, Social Security provides only enough for a bare-bones budget, about $14,000 a year on average.) The trouble with expecting workers to save on their own is that almost half of U.S. families have no such retirement account, according the Federal Reserve's 2016 Survey of Consumer \u00adFinances. Of those who do have retirement accounts, moreover, their savings are far too scant to support a typical retirement. The median account, among workers at the median income level, is about $25,000. \"The U.S. retirement system, and the workers and retirees it was designed to help, face major challenges,\" according to an October report by the Government Accountability Office. \"Traditional pensions have become much less common, and individuals are increasingly responsible for planning and managing their own retirement savings accounts.\" The GAO further warned that \"many households are ill-equipped for this task and have little or no retirement savings.\" The GAO recommended that Congress consider creating an independent commission to study the U.S. retirement system. \"If no action is taken, a retirement crisis could be looming,\" it said.Coomer makes a pot of coffee at his home in Wagoner after a day of work at Walmart. \"As long as I sit down for about 10 minutes every hour or two, I'm fine,\" he says of working eight-hour shifts with the condition spinal stenosis. (Nick Oxford for The Washington Post) Source: The Washington Post \u200b 'We were stunned' Employees at McDonnell Douglas in the early '90s enjoyed one of the more generous types of pensions, those known as \"30 and out.\" Employees with 30 years on the job could retire with a full pension once they reached age 55. But, as the employees would later learn, the generosity of those pensions made them, in lean times, an appealing target for cost-cutters. Those lean times for McDonnell Douglas began in earnest in the early '90s. Some plants closed. But for the remaining employees, including those at the Tulsa plant, executives said, there was hope: If Congress allowed the multibillion-dollar sale of 72 F-15s to Saudi Arabia, the new business would rescue the company. In fact, the company said in its 1991 annual report, it would save 7,000 jobs. To help win approval for the sale, Tulsa employees wrote letters to politicians. They held a rally with local politicians and the governor of Oklahoma. Eventually, in September 1992, President George H.W. Bush approved the sale. It seemed the Tulsa plant had weathered the storm. The headline in the Oklahoman, one of the state's largest newspapers, proclaimed: \"F-15 Sale to Saudi Arabia Saves Jobs of Tulsa Workers.\" But it hadn't. Within months, executives at the company again turned to cost-cutting. They considered closing a plant in Florida, another in Mesa, Ariz., or the Tulsa facility. Tulsa, it was noted, had the oldest hourly employees \u200a\u2014\u200a the average employee was 51 and had worked there for about 20 years. Many were close to getting a full pension, and that meant closing it would yield bigger savings in retirement costs. \"One day in December '93 they came on the loudspeaker and said, 'Attention, employees,' Coomer recalled. \"We were going to close. We were stunned. Just ran around like a bunch of chickens.\" A few years later, McDonnell Douglas, which continued to struggle, merged with Boeing. But the employees had taken their case to court, and in 2001, a federal judge agreed McDonnell Douglas had illegally considered the pensions in its decision to close the plant. The employees' case, presented by attorneys Joe Farris and Mike Mulder, showed the company had tracked pension savings in its plant closure decisions. The judge found McDonnell Douglas, moreover, had offered misleading testimony in its defense of the plant closing. The judge, Sven Erik Holmes, blasted the company for a \"corporate culture of mendacity.\" Employees eventually won settlements\u200a \u2014 \u200aabout $30,000 was typical. It helped carry people over to find new jobs. But the amount was limited to cover the benefits of three years of employment \u200a\u2014 \u200aand it was far less than the loss in pension and retiree health benefits. Because their pension benefits accrued most quickly near retirement age, the pensions they receive are only a small fraction of what they would have had they worked until full eligibility. \"People went to work at these places thinking they'll work there their whole lives,\" Farris said, noting that the pensions held great appeal to the staff. \"Their trust and loyalty, though, was not reciprocated.\"Ray walks through a collection of junk that he recycles at his home in Claremore.

Yet all but a handful said their new wages were only about half of what they had been making. Typically, their pay dropped in half, from about $20 per hour to $10 per hour.

Each time he realized that with just a Social Security check, \"You can hardly make it these days.\" So here he is at 79, working full-time at Walmart. During each eight-hour shift, he stands at the store entrance greeting customers, telling a joke and fetching a \"buggy.\" Or he is stationed at the exit, checking receipts and the shoppers that trip the theft alarm. \"As long as I sit down for about 10 minutes every hour or two, I'm fine,\" he said during a break. Diagnosed with spinal stenosis in his back, he recently forwarded a doctor's note to managers. \"They got me a stool.\" The way major U.S. companies provide for retiring workers has been shifting for about three decades, with more dropping traditional pensions every year. The first full generation of workers to retire since this turn offers a sobering preview of a labor force more and more dependent on their own savings for retirement. Years ago, Coomer and his co-workers at the Tulsa plant of McDonnell Douglas, the famed airplane maker, were enrolled in the company pension, but in 1994, with an eye toward cutting retirement costs, the company closed the plant. Now, The Washington Post found in a review of those 998 workers, that even though most of them found new jobs, they could never replace their lost pension benefits and many are facing financial struggles in their old age: 1 in 7 has in their retirement years filed for bankruptcy, faced liens for delinquent bills, or both, according to public records. Those affected are buried by debts incurred for credit cards, used cars, health care and sometimes, the college educations of their children. Some have lost their homes. And for many of them, even as they reach beyond 70, real retirement is elusive. Although they worked for decades at McDonnell Douglas, many of the septuagenarians are still working, some full-time.

A blockchain is a data structure. It is like a public digital ledger of all transactions that are shared amongst a network of computers. This chain keeps growing as new transactions and 'blocks' are added to it and when new records are added this creates a linear blockchain. With the help of blockchain the intermediary is no longer needed thus blockchain provides an efficient way for companies to conduct their transactions and verify them without the need for a separate, central authority. Why should the pensions industry adopt blockchain? In 2016 APG, a Dutch asset management company who oversees the biggest pension fund in the Netherlands, announced that it was looking into the possibility of using blockchain in the fields of financial services and logistics. Blockchain offers several advantages that the UK pension industry can also benefit from: Security: Blockchain uses cryptography. This allows each of the participants on the network to the use digital ledger and makes changes in a completely secure way. Therefore, with the help of cryptography, the ledger is public but also safe and trustworthy for clients. Circulation of information: With blockchain the firm that is using it will not need any separate central authority so that the information can be shared with others. Blockchain provides its users with a shared ledger that can be seen and verified by any participant who have been added to that network. Immutability: The meaning of immutability is unchanging. So, blockchain technology has been designed in a way that once the required changes have been, made there can be no tampering or further amendment. This means that the transactions that are added to the records in that public digital ledger are a 100% accurate and cannot be tampered with anyway. This makes blockchain technology not only safe but completely trust worthy and very open to audit and scrutiny by pension administrators and clients alike. The pension industry has to handle multiple financial information and transactions and blockchain could make the management of finances and transactions much easier and simpler. The technology is safe so it is guaranteed that the pensions of clients will not be tampered with and they will receive their pension on time and in full with full transparency of the management of the pension fund. The biggest single advantage of blockchain, compared to older pension technology, is that it is incredibly safe from hackers which make it valuable to the pension industry, or indeed any industry where financial governance and security is a must have. For a hacker to access the public ledger of one network, they would have to hack into every individual computer used in the blockchain, this makes blockchain technology virtually un-hackable. What Microsoft have done with there announcement of Block Chain as a Service (BaaS), hosted on their Azure platform, is to bridge the gap between blockchain technology and its enterprise deployment on Azure. One of its key areas of focus remains middleware integrations \"to make ledgers more approachable for developers and enterprise end users.\" Overall, Microsoft's efforts are directed to ensure that Azure is the preferred way to connect blockchain with the real world. With cybersecurity being a key boardroom issue of concern, is it not time for this modern approach to securing data to be considered a viable option for the pensions industry?

Circulation of information: With blockchain the firm that is using it will not need any separate central authority so that the information can be shared with others. Blockchain provides its users with a shared ledger that can be seen and verified by any participant who have been added to that network. Immutability: The meaning of immutability is unchanging. So, blockchain technology has been designed in a way that once the required changes have been, made there can be no tampering or further amendment. This means that the transactions that are added to the records in that public digital ledger are a 100% accurate and cannot be tampered with anyway. This makes blockchain technology not only safe but completely trust worthy and very open to audit and scrutiny by pension administrators and clients alike. The pension industry has to handle multiple financial information and transactions and blockchain could make the management of finances and transactions much easier and simpler. The technology is safe so it is guaranteed that the pensions of clients will not be tampered with and they will receive their pension on time and in full with full transparency of the management of the pension fund. The biggest single advantage of blockchain, compared to older pension technology, is that it is incredibly safe from hackers which make it valuable to the pension industry, or indeed any industry where financial governance and security is a must have. For a hacker to access the public ledger of one network, they would have to hack into every individual computer used in the blockchain, this makes blockchain technology virtually un-hackable. What Microsoft have done with there announcement of Block Chain as a Service (BaaS), hosted on their Azure platform, is to bridge the gap between blockchain technology and its enterprise deployment on Azure. One of its key areas of focus remains middleware integrations \"to make ledgers more approachable for developers and enterprise end users.\" Overall, Microsoft's efforts are directed to ensure that Azure is the preferred way to connect blockchain with the real world. With cybersecurity being a key boardroom issue of concern, is it not time for this modern approach to securing data to be considered a viable option for the pensions industry?

Pension funds and schemes often fall victim to systemic mismanagement and fraud , with little to no accountability. As a result of this ( and some bad luck ), the world's developed economies are over $70 trillion short on their pension obligations. This problem is still fixable. But before you can secure your own post-retirement future or help the world, it's important to understand why future pensioners may have to live in poverty. And to do that, we need to talk about the 3 problems listed above, starting with mismanagement. Mismanagement Most of Europe's large economies\u200a \u2014 \u200a Belgium , France , Germany and others\u200a \u2014 \u200ahave pay as you go pensions . This means collected from workers pays for current pension obligations instead of being saved for the future. This approach has its own downsides , but it does have an advantage. There are no pension funds , so there's nothing to mismanage . This protects EU pensioners from fund managers' mistakes. Of course, some EU countries and many US states have state pension funds. The ones that don't have private-owned ones . Both can be (and often are) mismanaged , losing their beneficiaries' money long before it's needed. Here's an example. Sweden's private pensions system used to let people invest with Maltese-based Falcon Fund . The latter defrauded 22,000 investors of over 2 billion Swedish kroner . That's an instance of fraud , which we'll get to in point 3 \u200a\u2014 \u200abut it couldn't have happened if Sweden's Pension Agency had a better vetting process. And that's mismanagement . Here's another example of mismanagement . In 1999, South Carolina's pension plans were 99% funded . However, the S.C. Retirement System Investment Commission performed so poorly the state's pensions are now $24 billion short . Meanwhile, the top 10 officials in the Investment Commission make an average of about $200,000 ; about 2x more than SC governor Nikki Haley. Scenarios like these are sad, but they're not uncommon. They point to consistent, systemic problems in how the world's economies deal with pensions. And the worst part is that governments and private funds may default on hundreds of millions of pensioners' debt obligations. Here's why. Broken Promises Pension money gets mismanaged often. They often end up short on money, even when fully funded \u200a\u2014\u200a and the issue is systemic. The US has a $4 trillion deficit in pension savings . The developed world as a whole is $78 trillion short. Meanwhile, the Gross World Product is only $78.28 trillion \u2014 \u200ameaning the deficit won't be easy to fix anytime soon.

In those countries, current workers \u200a\u2014\u200a who are also voters \u200a\u2014 \u200apay for retirees' pensions. What's to stop these taxpayers from electing to stop paying for older generations' pensions? You probably know the answer. Nothing. If the burden of pension payments gets too big, nothing stops workers from defaulting on old obligations. So far, most countries have managed to keep their pension systems running smoothly. But with a pension gap that's already comparable to the GDP (and growing), hundreds of millions of people may find themselves with absolutely no post-retirement security . Last but not least, let's talk about the third reason tomorrow's pensioners may live in poverty. Fraud Fraud is the last problem with pensions \u200a\u2014\u200a and it's more common than you may think. Just look at what happened to a few OECD countries' pension schemes in 2017\u20132018 . South Africa's government pension fund lost billions of rand by investing in the (apparently) fraudulent conglomerate, Steinhoff . Virginia's Attorney General is accusing BNY Mellon of defrauding Virginia's pension scheme of $20 million . And, in the Swedish pension fraud case above, it became clear that Falcon Fund was incapable of paying back the money it owed. And this is not to mention hundreds of instances of local , smaller-scale fraud and criminal mismanagement !

In all, over 40,000 headlines have been posted to the website to date. On a recent Friday, Dean posted multiple stories on the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the country's largest pension program, as well as a budget cliff facing San Francisco, six Los Angeles public safety officers who collected over $1 million apiece last year in pensions, and eight cities that could face bankruptcy when the next recession hits.

New Jersey and the cities of Chicago, Houston and Dallas are some of the issuers in the crosshairs. Morgan Stanley says municipal bond issuance is down this year in part because of borrowers are wary of running up new debts to effectively service pensions. Source: Bloomberg \u200b Federal Reserve data show that in 1952, the average public pension had 96 percent of its portfolio invested in bonds and cash equivalents. Assets matched future liabilities. But a loosening of state laws in the 1980s opened the door to riskier investments. In 1992, fixed income and cash had fallen to an average of 47 percent of holdings. By 2016, these safe investments had declined to 27 percent. It's no coincidence that pensions' flight from safety has coincided with the drop in interest rates. That said, unlike their private peers, public pensions discount their liabilities using the rate of returns they assume their overall portfolio will generate. In fiscal 2016, which ended June 30th, the average return for public pensions was somewhere in the neighborhood of 1.5 percent. Corporations' accounting rules dictate the use of more realistic bond yields to discount their pensions' future liabilities. Put differently, companies have been forced to set aside something closer to what it will really cost to service their obligations as opposed to the fantasy figures allowed among public pensions. So why not just flip the switch and require truth and honesty in public pension math? Too many cities and potentially states would buckle under the weight of more realistic assumed rates of return. By some estimates, unfunded liabilities would triple to upwards of $6 trillion if the prevailing yields on Treasuries were used. That would translate into much steeper funding requirements at a time when budgets are already severely constrained. Pockets of the country would face essential public service budgets being slashed to dangerous levels. What's a pension to do? Increasingly, the answer is swing for the fences. Forget the fact that just under half of pension assets are in the second-most overvalued stock market in history. Even as Fed officials publicly fret about commercial real estate valuations, pensions have socked away eight percent of their portfolios into this less than liquid asset class.

A \"best case\" scenario of a cumulative 25% investment return during the 2017\u20132019 period will not offer a respite for chronically underfunded U.S. public pension plans, according to a Moody's Investors Service report. The growing gap between how much state and local governments are projected to pay employees and how much funds they actually have set aside has risen to over $4 trillion nationwide. New Jersey sports the widest funding gap, followed closely by Kentucky and Illinois. Source: Bloomberg The optimistic \"best case\" of cumulative 25% investment return would reduce net pension liabilities by just 1% through 2019 year-end because of past bad investment returns and weak contributions. Meanwhile, the \"base case\" scenario of 19% returns would see net pension liabilities rise by 15%. \"For many states and municipalities, exposure to unfunded pension liabilities is already at or near all-time highs. Since cost burdens are already expected to further increase, pension fund investment performance is critical for the credit quality of many governments,\" the report noted.

Governments bail them out, or banks absorb their obligations. Business carries on as usual . This is a recurring pattern in the world economy. Pension plans fail, and someone steps in to save them. This is why the US has a Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation; why most EU governments fund pensions out of current taxes; why Brazil spends a whopping 11.3% of its GDP on pensions. It's that important that pensions get paid. And since pension schemes often find themselves broke or underfunded, 3rd parties intervene a lot. But what happens when pension schemes go broke and nobody steps in to save the day? What happens when pension schemes, funds and systems collapse permanently? In this 3-part series, we'll show you 5 real-life outcomes of complete pension scheme failure . In the first part, we'll look at a Stateside example: that of Prichard, Alabama . Prichard, Alabama Many people feel that living in an OECD country protects their pension. As you're about to see, they are wrong. The EU, the US and other developed countries can all leave retirees penniless. Here's one example. Prichard, Alabama, is a small town on the outskirts of Mobile, Alabama. Its pension fund was running out of money for years \u200a\u2014\u200a but the town's administration ignored all warnings. By 2009, Prichard's pension fund was 100% dry\u2026 So Prichard just stopped paying its 150+ retirees . This was in clear violation of state laws, but that didn't matter. Pensioners like Nettie Banks, a retired police and fire dispatcher, were left with no recourse to public funds. Other local stories were even more unfortunate. Police Captain Eddie Ragland was left unable to work after being badly wounded by a robber. Aged 59 and with no state pension, he had to rely on donations, bake sale proceeds and his neighbors to survive. Another Prichard pensioner\u200a \u2014 \u200athe retired fire marshal\u200a \u2014\u200a refused such help, and lived with no electricity or running water until found dead. The Prichard example shows that it doesn't matter where you live. The government isn't always going to step in to help. As a pensioner, you can find yourself poor in a heartbeat\u200a \u2014\u200a even if you live in a developed country where you worked as a state employee.

In this post, we'll look at 2 more examples of pension schemes that let retirees down. The first is\u2026 2. The National Bus Employees Superannuation Trust In the 80s, Margaret Thatcher's government was busy privatizing Britain's state-run services. One company they broke up and privatized was the National Bus Company , which had a particularly excellent employee pension plan. This NBS's pension plan was aptly called BEST: the Bus Employees' Superannuation Trust . Bus drivers and bus crews were often victims of assaults, violence, stress and more \u200a\u2014 \u200aso BEST was generous, and allowed for early retirement. As a result of this, the BEST fund had a sizeable surplus at the time it was privatized. The idea was for this surplus to improve retirees' pensions. To that end, BEST had an extra \u00a3168 million , paid by bus drivers and bus crews, to distribute among retirees. That's a lot of money\u200a \u2014 \u200abut what happened next was both unfortunate and criminal. Seeing the excess \u00a3168 million , the government decided to pocket it prior to privatization. It had undersold the National Bus Company by \u00a3300 million , so this was its way of making up some of the losses. Put more simply, the British government sold off a national company\u2026 But only after gutting its pension fund and taking \u00a3168 million from current and future pensioners. Now, to be fair, Margaret Thatcher's government only took the surplus money from BEST's beneficiaries. To be even more fair, a 13-year legal and political campaign did end in the Labour Government agreeing to return the money. But all of that is little consolation. The state had raided the BEST fund and gutted it on a whim. The National Bus Company employees had to rely on Britain's national pension\u200a \u2014 \u200aone of the worst-funded in the world\u200a \u2014\u200a instead. And that's the second time a major pension scheme collapsed, leaving millions worse off. Even developed states can and do take money from pensioners like Britain did in the above example. Things are even worse for underdeveloped states\u200a \u2014 \u200aas you're about to see in the next example. 3. How USSR's Pensioners Ended Up Penniless The USSR was a communist nation, meaning everyone worked for the state or a state-owned company \u200a\u2014\u200aand could count on a state pension after retirement. Unfortunately, the USSR dissolved in 1991 , leaving its successor state (Russia) to make good on its obligations. How did this go for Russia's pensioners? Well, after World War 2 , the USSR was the other superpower. You'd think that the people who helped build the state would enjoy some of its past prosperity \u200a\u2014 \u200aeven during an economic downturn. And you'd be wrong. By the time the USSR dissolved, inflation was running wild and national reserves were empty. There was no money to give state retirees. So around 1992\u20131993, the average Russian pensioner got 5\u201315 USD per month . By 1995 , the situation improved\u2026 With pensioners receiving 50 USD per month. Then came Russia's 1998 default when things got worse again, with pensions regressing to 19 USD. At the end of it all, tens of millions of pensioners were living below the poverty line. And this is not to mention that pensions often went unpaid, with the government's debt to pensioners standing at 17 trillion Russian Rubles by 1997 . By sheer magnitude, this is probably the biggest collapse on this list. USSR's workers had no choice but to work for the state. The state was their only source of post-retirement income. And in the end, it failed them completely and unexpectedly. In the next part of our post, we'll look at an ancient example of unpaid pensions, then go back to cover modern America's biggest collapsed private pension fund.

In this final part, we'll change things up by looking at a historical example of pension fund failure . We'll also cover what happens when a private company decides (or has no choice but) to stop paying pensions . 4. Ancient Rome Modern pensions are a new invention. However, past cultures \u200a\u2014 \u200aespecially warrior cultures\u200a \u2014 \u200aalso had pensions for soldiers . From Ancient Rome 's soldier-pensioners to Napoleon 's demi soldes , it's never been uncommon for soldier retirees to get governmental support. Just take Ancient Rome . From the 5th century BC, a soldier discharged honorably (with an honesta missio ) was entitled to several things, one of which was a pension . A full pension package included money, Roman citizenship and permission to marry a Roman ( conubium ). Together, these benefits became very enticing, and encouraged an ever-growing number of young men to serve. Unfortunately, the Roman empire eventually couldn't fund its pension obligations. Its currency devalued, inflation was high, and government pensions lost their luster. Thus collapsed the Roman national pension scheme\u200a \u2014\u200a leading, some believe, to the empire's ultimate demise. Last but not least, let's look at a different example. This case is unique, because pensioners were protected by their employer and the government\u2026 And lost their pension fund anyway. Here's how. 5. The United Airlines Bankruptcy The United States Government has guaranteed pensions since the 1970s . However, the United Airlines bankruptcy is an excellent example that government protection isn't everything \u2014 \u200aeven when coupled with working for a big corporation. Here's what happened. United Airlines declared bankruptcy in 2002 . The government bailed it out, but to make the numbers add up, UA had to default on many of its obligations. One of the things they defaulted on was over $9 bn of pension obligations . Usually, this wouldn't be possible, but the government's Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation absorbed the obligations , albeit at a large discount. What this meant, in laymen's terms, was that over 130,000 UA employees were left with as little as 50% of the money they were promised. It didn't matter that they worked for a large corporation in a cash-rich industry. It didn't matter that the US government \"guarantees\" pensions. As with all the examples above, pensioners were left with far less than promised. And there you have it. Now you know how 5 major pension schemes \u200a\u2014 \u200afrom the Roman Empire's to United Airlines \u200a\u2014 \u200afailed, leaving millions destitute. The question is, do you still trust your pension plan? And if not, what are you doing to make sure you and your family don't end up living in poverty once you retire?

United Airlines declared bankruptcy in 2002 . The government bailed it out, but to make the numbers add up, UA had to default on many of its obligations. One of the things they defaulted on was over $9 bn of pension obligations . Usually, this wouldn't be possible, but the government's Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation absorbed the obligations , albeit at a large discount. What this meant, in laymen's terms, was that over 130,000 UA employees were left with as little as 50% of the money they were promised. It didn't matter that they worked for a large corporation in a cash-rich industry. It didn't matter that the US government \"guarantees\" pensions. As with all the examples above, pensioners were left with far less than promised. And there you have it. Now you know how 5 major pension schemes \u200a\u2014 \u200afrom the Roman Empire's to United Airlines \u200a\u2014 \u200afailed, leaving millions destitute. The question is, do you still trust your pension plan? And if not, what are you doing to make sure you and your family don't end up living in poverty once you retire?

Many people think that inflation measures how much a static basket of products changes in price over time\u200a \u2014 \u200a but this is wrong . In reality, inflation figures show how much the average household's spending changes year-on-year. In the US , these spending figures show up in the Customer Price Index . In the EU , they show up in the HCIP (Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices) . But although the HCIP , CPI and other indices track a broad basket of items across different categories, they don't show us the specific products people are buying. This can mask a lot of inflation \u200a\u2014\u200a and here's how. Let's say it's 2018 and the entire state of Arizona buys bread for $1.20 . The brand they buy is called Arizona Bread and everyone loves it.

Now, the way a regular consumer might look at it, bread just got 20% more expensive . But if you look at inflation figures , they might show you 0% inflation because the price of bread stayed the same. And that's what inflation is. A change in spending; not a change in the price of specific products. It's very important to understand this distinction, because the way inflation is calculated masks price shifts that make consumers switch to cheaper products. Unfortunately, this is just one of several reasons it's hard to gauge inflation accurately.

You can read all about it here \u2014 but the gist is this. Inflation doesn't track prices for products over time. It just tracks changes in household spending, without reflecting whether an individual product got more expensive or not. Here's how this can (and does) disguise real-life inflation. In the EU , wages have been falling for 10 years . The UK , Portugal , Greece , Hungary and other countries have seen theirs fall every year since 2009 . The EU's largest economies \u200a\u2014 \u200a France and Germany \u2014\u200a have been doing a little better, but have also seen wages fall consistently since 2014 . Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic , annual US wages have only risen once since 2009 \u200a \u2014\u200a and the middle class has lost 30% of its wealth. In short, median incomes have fallen . Because of this, consumers can't afford to spend more . As a result, household spending \u200a\u200a\u2014\u200a\u200aand inflation \u2014 \u200aare both highly stable . This is the first (and biggest) reason inflation isn't higher. The second reason is that consumer price indices are subjective, and change over time. For example, in 2005 , housing costs were weighted at about 25% \u200a\u2014\u200a\u200abut that number has now risen to 40% . This means that homes are more expensive, but it also means consumer indices allot more money to housing costs, pushing down nominal inflation. In another example, the CPI weighs healthcare at just 8.6% when the US actually spends 18% of its GDP on medicine. This has a similar effect, reducing inflation figures while still leaving consumers with far less disposable income. So how far apart is nominal and real-life inflation? To get a realistic idea, let's look at 2 famous alternative price indices and their rate of inflation. 2 Alternative Price Indices In this section, we'll look at 2 alternative price indices . Unlike the USA's CPI and the EU's HCI P, these indices measure the price of 2 in-demand commodities: Big Macs and gold . This makes them more concrete, if less balanced, than the CPI and HCIP . We'll start with gold , which cost under $800 in Q3 2007 \u200a\u200a\u2014\u200a\u200aand now costs over $1300 (after a short-term peak in 2011\u20132013). That's a 62.5% price difference, or an annualized 4.9% . That may not seem like much\u200a\u200a\u2014\u200a\u200abut when you compare it to the EU's official 1.5% or the US's 1.8%-2.1% , the difference is substantial. Now, you could argue that gold is an important commodity\u200a\u200a\u2014\u200a\u200abut a poor way to measure price changes over time. And that's a fair point, so let's look at our second index: that of the Big Mac . In 2012 , a stateside Big Ma c cost $4.33 . A French Big Mac cost $4.36 . 6 years later (2017) , these prices rose to $5.3 and $5.1 respectively. That's an annual Big Mac inflation rate of 4.1% for the US and 3.2% for the EU : nothing criminal, but far from official inflation rates . Again, these two indices are very subjective. But if both a fast food staple and gold are appreciating faster than inflation suggests, who's to say the same isn't happening for other assets and commodities? That's right. Nobody . Looking at these numbers, it's a little hard to believe that inflation is as low as OECD governments say it is\u200a\u200a\u2014\u200a\u200abut that's not all. In researching this article, we found that other (less common) goods and * services *may have appreciated far more than all the above numbers suggest. That might sound hyperbolic , but stay tuned for the next (and last) part of this series. We'll take a look at how much schools , cars and homes have appreciated in recent years\u200a\u200a\u2014\u200a\u200a and you may be surprised at the figures you see.

This time, we're going to look at specific examples of goods and services appreciating a lot faster than we think. Specifically, we'll look at cars , homes , education and clothes , all of which have gotten a lot more expensive in the last decade. First on our list are\u2026 Clothes In the last couple of decades , we've seen a boom of \"fast fashion\" brands like Zara , H&M and Topshop . Anecdotally, shoppers know that as recently as 5\u20137 years ago, it was difficult to find an item priced at $100 in any of these brands' offerings. Today, though, fast fashion price points of $100 , $200 and $300 are all common. In other words, fast fashion quickly went from a cheap alternative to high-end brands to being fairly expensive . And if you look at other fashion segments, you'll see a similar change . Next up, let's look at cars . Cars In the late 20th century US , a car was a staple rather than a luxury . Anecdotally, most median-income households could buy a car by sticking to the 20/4/10 rule : 20% of your income on a down payment, then 10% of your income to pay for interest and insurance over 4 years. Today, things are very different. Using the 20/4/10 rule, a median Miami resident has $13,577 to buy a car. For comparison, the average new car actually costs $35,368 . That's a big gap, and it shows that new cars\u200a \u2014\u200a heck, all cars \u200a\u2014 \u200aare now out of reach for the median American . (In other countries, where cars tend to be more expensive, things are often worse, with cars being completely out of the question for many families.) Now let's move on to another important cost: that of owning or renting a home. Homes In much of the developed world , homes have never been more expensive . A 1940 home would cost the average American family $2,938 . Adjusted for inflation, that's under $40,000 in today's dollars. But today, an actual U.S. home costs well over $200,000 ; a 500% difference after you adjust for inflation . Clearly, homes are far more expensive than inflation numbers suggest. A similar pattern emerges in Europe . In countries like Italy , France and Spain , the house price:disposable income ratio has gone up by 50% or more in the last 2 decades . Europeans have never paid so much for homes; same as Americans. Last but not least, let's talk about\u2026 Education In the United States , college fees have appreciated 4x faster than the CPI since the 1940s . This means that, once again, inflation figures don't capture the extent to which education has become more expensive. In Europe , things are a little better. Nordic countries and welfare states like Belgium and France still offer education for relatively little money. But in other countries, fees can go up very quickly (and unexpectedly). Case in point: the UK famously tripled university fees in 2013\u20132014 , and Ireland's university fees are currently in line with the US's . In short, education is getting more expensive on both sides of the ocean\u200a\u2014\u200aand at a far greater speed than inflation figures suggest. And there you have it. Although official inflation figures are low, everything is getting more expensive\u200a\u2014\u200aand fast.

This time, we're going to look at specific examples of goods and services appreciating a lot faster than we think. Specifically, we'll look at cars , homes , education and clothes , all of which have gotten a lot more expensive in the last decade. First on our list are\u2026 Clothes In the last couple of decades , we've seen a boom of \"fast fashion\" brands like Zara , H&M and Topshop . Anecdotally, shoppers know that as recently as 5\u20137 years ago, it was difficult to find an item priced at $100 in any of these brands' offerings. Today, though, fast fashion price points of $100 , $200 and $300 are all common. In other words, fast fashion quickly went from a cheap alternative to high-end brands to being fairly expensive . And if you look at other fashion segments, you'll see a similar change . Next up, let's look at cars . Cars In the late 20th century US , a car was a staple rather than a luxury . Anecdotally, most median-income households could buy a car by sticking to the 20/4/10 rule : 20% of your income on a down payment, then 10% of your income to pay for interest and insurance over 4 years. Today, things are very different. Using the 20/4/10 rule, a median Miami resident has $13,577 to buy a car. For comparison, the average new car actually costs $35,368 . That's a big gap, and it shows that new cars\u200a \u2014\u200a heck, all cars \u200a\u2014 \u200aare now out of reach for the median American . (In other countries, where cars tend to be more expensive, things are often worse, with cars being completely out of the question for many families.) Now let's move on to another important cost: that of owning or renting a home. Homes In much of the developed world , homes have never been more expensive . A 1940 home would cost the average American family $2,938 . Adjusted for inflation, that's under $40,000 in today's dollars. But today, an actual U.S. home costs well over $200,000 ; a 500% difference after you adjust for inflation . Clearly, homes are far more expensive than inflation numbers suggest. A similar pattern emerges in Europe . In countries like Italy , France and Spain , the house price:disposable income ratio has gone up by 50% or more in the last 2 decades . Europeans have never paid so much for homes; same as Americans. Last but not least, let's talk about\u2026 Education In the United States , college fees have appreciated 4x faster than the CPI since the 1940s . This means that, once again, inflation figures don't capture the extent to which education has become more expensive. In Europe , things are a little better. Nordic countries and welfare states like Belgium and France still offer education for relatively little money. But in other countries, fees can go up very quickly (and unexpectedly). Case in point: the UK famously tripled university fees in 2013\u20132014 , and Ireland's university fees are currently in line with the US's . In short, education is getting more expensive on both sides of the ocean\u200a\u2014\u200aand at a far greater speed than inflation figures suggest. And there you have it. Although official inflation figures are low, everything is getting more expensive\u200a\u2014\u200aand fast.
