# Delphi FAQ

## Product

### What is Delphi?

Delphi is a DeFi yield farming aggregator and Dollar Cost Averaging tool that offers synthetic savings and high yield “accounts” aimed at DeFi-curious users with no deep technical knowledge and some understanding of Ethereum and crypto. Delphi was built by the Akropolis team and is the second product built on AkropolisOS.

### How does it work?

Connect your wallet
Choose one or several pools that currently provides the best yield farming opportunities
Choose if you want to deposit all available funds or Dollar Cost Averaging into those pools
Relax.
What pools are in the savings tab?
Savings tab is all about stablecoins pools. Currently, you can choose where to supply liquidity from selected Curve.fi and Compound pools. You can allocate in one or several pools in once click - just choose amounts & currencies, click on Allocate & chill - your funds will be sent to the corresponding pools, earn interest & farm different tokens all at once.
What is All-in in the Investment tab?
All-in in the Investment tab is similar to savings with one big difference - all pools contain volatile assets, so risks connected to impermanent loss are much higher. Just choose the pool you’re willing to supply liquidity to & confirm deposit -  chill while your funds earning interest & farming different tokens all at once.
What is DCA in the Investment tab?
DCA pools are the same investment pools with volatile assets. The logic works differently though:
All deposits are in USDC
Insert overall deposit amount & amount for weekly DCA, confirm deposit
Your deposit is sent to the savings pool (Compound USDC) where it constantly earns interest. 
On a weekly basis, your weekly DCA amount is withdrawn from the savings pool and sent to the exchange to buy the asset of your choice (BTC, ETH) or directly to the liquidity pool.
Assets bought through DCA are sent to the corresponding investment pool, where they earn interest.
All in all - you earn interest on your deposit, you earn interest on assets you bought via DCA, and you farm tokens on top.
What is DCA?
The Bitcoin community made DCA popular among exchanges like Coinbase with automated, periodic purchases, commonly referred to as “stacking sats.” Regardless of the asset, the DCA strategy has always been to invest periodically (weekly, monthly, etc) in an effort to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall purchase. The purchases occur regardless of the price and at regular intervals. DCA effectively removes much of the detailed work of attempting to time the market in order to make purchases of equities at the best prices.
