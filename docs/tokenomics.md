# Incentive Design & Token Utility


## Glossary


**Stability fee** - a reward for Network Keepers for staking in favor of "honest" Guilds (which members repay debts properly). This reward is charged as part of the interest rate of a loan.


**Penalty fee** - a penalty, applied in situation of default on debt of at least one Guild member to the stakes in her favor. It means, that all stakes are equally penalized for a certain percentage of tokens for every default even.


**Infra-network interest rate** - the maximum value of interest rate magnitude that can be applied to a loan.


**Governance fee** - the percentage of a debt, that is required to be paid in AKT tokens which are burned after that. Similar to MKR in MakerDAO.


**Staking**  - a process of placing AKT tokens as a risky deposit (or skin in the game) to special smart contract with purpose to perform “selection” of honest Guild by collective appraisement. If Guild members repay debt properly, the person who made a stake receive a reward in form of stability fee and (in some cases) additional reward in AKT tokens.
