# Delphi FAQ

## Product

### What is Delphi?

Delphi is a DeFi yield farming aggregator and Dollar Cost Averaging tool that offers synthetic savings and high yield “accounts” aimed at DeFi-curious users with no deep technical knowledge and some understanding of Ethereum and crypto. Delphi was built by the Akropolis team and is the second product built on AkropolisOS.

### Why Delphi?

Today, the DeFi area provides great opportunities for earning money through staking, yielding farming and providing liquidity. Each of the popular DeFi protocols offers its own reward options in the form of various percentages and different tokens.

Delphi, being an aggregator of yield-farming proposals, solves an important problem for DeFi-entry users - user-friendly interface with concise and understandable information.

Special attention was given to UI/UX problem in the development of this product, so we hope that as a result, the product usage will be convenient, easy and enjoyable for all categories of users - from beginners to experts.

As an additional features, Delphi decrease operating costs (gas in the Etherium network) and helps to diversify buying prices in long-term investment with DCA integrated approach.

### How does it work?

Connect your wallet.

Choose one or several pools that currently provides the best yield farming opportunities.

Choose if you want to deposit all available funds or Dollar Cost Averaging into those pools.

Relax.

### What is Savings?

Savings is all about stablecoins pools. Currently, you can choose where to supply liquidity from selected Curve.fi and Compound pools. You can allocate in one or several pools in once click - just choose amounts & currencies, click on Allocate & chill - your funds will be sent to the corresponding pools, earn interest & farm different tokens all at once.

### What is Investments?

Investments tab is similar to savings with one big difference - all pools contain volatile assets, so risks connected to impermanent loss are much higher. Just choose the pool you’re willing to supply liquidity to & confirm deposit -  chill while your funds earning interest & farming different tokens all at once.

### What is DCA?

The Bitcoin community made DCA popular among exchanges like Coinbase with automated, periodic purchases, commonly referred to as “stacking sats.” Regardless of the asset, the DCA strategy has always been to invest periodically (weekly, monthly, etc) in an effort to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall purchase. The purchases occur regardless of the price and at regular intervals. DCA effectively removes much of the detailed work of attempting to time the market in order to make purchases of equities at the best prices.

DCA pools are the same investment pools with volatile assets. The logic works differently though:

- All deposits are in USDC

- Insert overall deposit amount & amount for weekly DCA, confirm deposit

- Your deposit is sent to the savings pool (Compound USDC) where it constantly earns interest 

- On a weekly basis, your weekly DCA amount is withdrawn from the savings pool and sent to the exchange to buy the asset of your choice (BTC, ETH) or directly to the liquidity pool.

- Assets bought through DCA are sent to the corresponding investment pool, where they earn interest.

**NB! DCA are non-stablecoin pools. Higher risk-reward pools with higher volatility — higher potential capital gains and losses.**

### What is Staking?

Staking is a process of locking your assets to get the additional reward. Delphi provides the opportunity to stake AKRO to get the rewards in AKRO and ADEL tokens.
