# Why life is getting more expensive than inflation suggests, and what that means for you — Part II

In the _first part_ of our post, we talked about how **inflation doesn&#39;t measure real-life price changes**. You can read all about it [here](https://wiki.akropolis.io/library/2018%20Why%20life%20is%20getting%20more%20expensive%20than%20inflation%20suggests%201/)  —  but the gist is this.

Inflation doesn&#39;t track prices for products over time. It just tracks changes in household spending, without reflecting whether an individual product got more expensive or not.

**Here&#39;s how this can (and does) disguise real-life inflation.**

In the **EU**, wages have been [falling for 10 years](https://www.reinisfischer.com/average-salary-european-union-2017). The **UK**, **Portugal**, **Greece**, **Hungary** and other countries have seen theirs fall [**every year**](https://euro.indiana.edu/doc/archive/past-events/wcms_324678.pdf) [since 2009](https://euro.indiana.edu/doc/archive/past-events/wcms_324678.pdf). The **EU&#39;s** largest economies  —  **France** and **Germany**  —  have been doing a little better, but have also seen wages fall [consistently since 2014](https://www.reinisfischer.com/average-salary-european-union-2017).

Meanwhile, **on the other side of the Atlantic** , annual **US** wages have only risen **once** _since 2009_  —  and the middle class has lost **30%** of its wealth.

In short, _median incomes have fallen_. Because of this, _consumers can&#39;t afford to spend more_. As a result, **household spending**   —  and **inflation**  —  are both **highly stable**. This is _the first_ (and biggest) reason inflation isn&#39;t higher.

_The second reason_ is that **consumer price indices** are subjective, and change over time. For example, **in 2005** , housing costs were weighted at about **25%**  —  but that number has now [**risen to 40%**](http://slideplayer.com/slide/738105/)[.](http://slideplayer.com/slide/738105/) This means that homes are more expensive, but it also means consumer indices allot more money to housing costs, pushing down nominal inflation.

In another example, the **CPI** weighs healthcare at [**just 8.6%**](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2018/03/14/what-inflation-means-to-you-inside-the-consumer-price-index) when the **US** actually spends **18%** of its **GDP** on medicine. This has a similar effect, reducing inflation figures while still leaving consumers with _far_ less disposable income.

So how far apart is nominal and real-life inflation?

To get a realistic idea, **let&#39;s look at 2 famous alternative price indices and their rate of inflation.**

**2 Alternative Price Indices**

In this section, we&#39;ll look at _2 alternative price indices_. Unlike the **USA&#39;s CPI** and the **EU&#39;s HCI** P, these indices measure the price of **2** in-demand commodities: **Big Macs** and **gold**. This makes them more concrete, if less balanced, than the **CPI** and **HCIP**.

We&#39;ll start with **gold** , which cost [**under $800 in Q3 2007**](https://goldprice.org/)  —  and [**now costs over $1300**](https://goldprice.org/) (after a short-term peak in 2011–2013). That&#39;s a **62.5%** price difference, or an _annualized_ **4.9%**. That may not seem like much  —  but when you compare it to the [**EU&#39;s official 1.5%**](https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/inflation-cpi) or the [**US&#39;s 1.8%-2.1%**](http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/)[,](http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) the difference is substantial.

Now, you could argue that **gold** is an important commodity  —  but a poor way to measure price changes over time. And that&#39;s a fair point, so let&#39;s look at our second index: that of the **Big Mac**.

**In 2012** , **a stateside**  **Big Ma** _c_ cost [**$4.33**](https://www.economist.com/content/big-mac-index). **A French**  **Big Mac** cost [**$4.36**](http://bigmacindex.org/2012-big-mac-index.html). **6 years later (2017)**, these prices rose to **$5.3** and **$5.1** respectively. That&#39;s an annual **Big Mac** _inflation rate_ of **4.1%** for the **US** and **3.2%** for the **EU** : nothing criminal, _but far from official inflation rates_.

Again, these two indices are very subjective. But if both a fast food staple and gold are appreciating faster than inflation suggests, who&#39;s to say the same isn&#39;t happening for other assets and commodities?

That&#39;s right. **Nobody**. Looking at these numbers, it&#39;s a little hard to believe that inflation is as low as **OECD** governments say it is  —  but that&#39;s not all.

In researching this article, we found that **other** (less common) **goods and**** services **may have appreciated** far** more than all the above numbers suggest.

That might sound _hyperbolic_, but stay tuned for the next (and last) part of this series. We&#39;ll take a look at how much **schools** , **cars** and **homes** have appreciated in recent years  —  _and you may be surprised at the figures you see._
