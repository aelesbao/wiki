# Is Your Pension as Safe As You Think? 3 Reasons Tomorrow&#39;s Pensioners May Face Poverty

In a previous [article](https://medium.com/akropolis/3-reasons-the-pension-gap-will-reach-400-trillion-by-2050-a0b7db568361), we gave you **3 reasons the pension gap is projected to reach** [**$400 trillion**](https://www.etftrends.com/fixed-income-channel/global-pension-gap-expected-to-hit-400-trillion/) **by 2050**. Of those reasons, the last one  —   **fraud, mismanagement and broken promises**  — is the most _complex_, _systemic_ and _misunderstood_.

On one hand, nobody wants to strand future pensioners with no money. On the other hand, _future retirees are in bigger trouble than most people know_. **Pension funds** and **schemes** often fall victim to _systemic mismanagement and fraud_, with little to no accountability. As a result of this (_and some bad luck_), the world&#39;s developed economies are **over** [**$70 trillion short**](http://theonebrief.com/trillion-dollar-pension-gap-strategies-close/) on their pension obligations.

This problem is still fixable. But before you can secure your own post-retirement future or help the world, it&#39;s important to understand why future pensioners may have to live in poverty. And to do that, we need to talk about the 3 problems listed above, starting with mismanagement.

**Mismanagement**

Most of **Europe&#39;s** large economies  —   **Belgium**, **France**, **Germany** and others  —  have **pay as you go pensions**. This means collected from workers pays for current pension obligations instead of being saved for the future.

This approach has its own _downsides_, but it does have an advantage. There are **no pension funds** , so there&#39;s n **othing to mismanage**. This protects **EU** pensioners from fund managers&#39; mistakes.

Of course, some **EU** countries and many **US** states have state pension funds. The ones that don&#39;t have _private-owned ones_. Both can be (and often are) **mismanaged**, losing their beneficiaries&#39; money long before it&#39;s needed.

Here&#39;s an example. **Sweden&#39;s** _private pensions system_ used to let people invest with Maltese-based **Falcon Fund**_._ The latter [**defrauded 22,000 investors**](http://www.europeanpensions.net/ep/Maltese-pension-fund-faces-criminal-investigation-on-fraudulent-investment-activity.php) _of_ **over 2 billion Swedish kroner**_._

That&#39;s an instance of **fraud**, which we&#39;ll get to in point 3  —  but it couldn&#39;t have happened if **Sweden&#39;s Pension Agency** had a better vetting process. And _that&#39;s_ **mismanagement**.

Here&#39;s another example of **mismanagement**. In 1999, **South Carolina&#39;s** pension plans were [**99% funded**](https://www.postandcourier.com/news/south-carolina-s-looming-pension-crisis/article_dd4cd1e2-b03d-11e6-9d85-7b24e6e338ed.html). However, the **S.C. Retirement System Investment Commission** performed so poorly the state&#39;s pensions are now **$24 billion short**. Meanwhile, _the top 10 officials_ in the **Investment Commission** make an average of about **$200,000**; about **2x** more than SC governor Nikki Haley.

Scenarios like these are sad, but they&#39;re not uncommon. They point to consistent, systemic problems in how the world&#39;s economies deal with pensions.

_And the worst part is that governments and private funds may default on hundreds of millions of pensioners&#39; debt obligations._ **Here&#39;s why**_._

**Broken Promises**

**Pension money gets mismanaged often.** They often end up short on money, even when fully funded  —  and the issue is systemic.

The **US** has a [**$4 trillion deficit in pension savings**](https://www.ft.com/content/f2891b34-3705-11e7-99bd-13beb0903fa3). The developed world as a whole is **$78** trillion short. Meanwhile, the **Gross World Product** is only **$78.28 trillion**  —  meaning the deficit won&#39;t be easy to fix anytime soon. _(Especially not with a rapidly aging world population)._

Now here&#39;s the problem. Most developed countries have **pay as you go pensions**; something we explained above. In those countries, current workers  —  who are also voters  —  pay for retirees&#39; pensions.

What&#39;s to stop these taxpayers from electing to stop paying for older generations&#39; pensions? You probably know the answer. Nothing. If the burden of pension payments gets too big, nothing stops workers from defaulting on old obligations.

So far, most countries have managed to keep their pension systems running smoothly. But with a pension gap that&#39;s already comparable to the **GDP** _(and growing),_ hundreds of millions of people may find themselves with absolutely **no post-retirement security**.

_Last but not least, let&#39;s talk about the third reason tomorrow&#39;s pensioners may live in poverty:_ **fraud** _._

**Fraud**

**Fraud is the last problem with pensions**  —  and it&#39;s more common than you may think. Just look at what happened to a few **OECD** countries&#39; pension schemes in **2017–2018**.

**South Africa&#39;s** government pension fund lost billions of rand by investing in the [_(apparently) fraudulent conglomerate, Steinhoff_](http://www.dw.com/en/south-african-pension-fund-scandal-the-damage-will-be-immense/a-42388940). Virginia&#39;s Attorney General is accusing **BNY Mellon** of [_defrauding Virginia&#39;s pension scheme of $20 million_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/virginias-cuccinelli-sues-bank-of-new-york-mellon-alleging-pension-fraud/2011/08/11/gIQAKTfg9I_story.html?utm_term=.2b6a1d6c5071). And, in the Swedish pension fraud case above, it became clear that **Falcon Fund** was incapable of paying back the money it owed.

And this is not to mention hundreds of instances of **local**, **smaller-scale fraud** and **criminal mismanagement**!

**Now let&#39;s recap by listing the 3 key reasons pensioners may live in poverty by 2050:**

1. **Fraud**
2. **Mismanagement**
3. **Broken promises**

The natural question is, can we do anything to change the situation  —  and can you avoid spending your golden years scrimping and saving?

We believe so, which is why we&#39;re hard at work on a decentralized, blockchain-powered alternative to centralized pensions. With our solution, smart contracts and a sophisticated blockchain protocol would optimize pension funds&#39; return rates while eliminating fraud.
