# The £1 trillion pension crisis facing 11m (and they&#39;re the lucky ones)

One form of compromise could result in savers losing some of their retirement benefits.

Pressure is mounting on the Government to oversee a root-and-branch overhaul of Britain&#39;s company pension schemes in which more than 11 million workers have savings.

It comes as these &quot;final salary&quot; schemes are registering their biggest ever funding shortfall, now at almost £1 trillion (£1,000bn).

This sum is the gap between the investments these pension schemes own and the likely eventual cost of the pensions they have already promised to pay.

Unless solutions are found, experts warn, many hundreds of schemes are likely to fold into the Pension Protection Fund, the lifeboat scheme which provides reduced pension payouts for retired workers caught up in cash-strapped schemes.

Trying to force an employer to pay every last penny of promised pension may be counter-productive. We do not want to make the &#39;best&#39; the enemy of the &#39;good&#39;  —  **Baroness Altmann, former Pensions Minister**

And while that may be bad news for scheme members, there will be difficulties faced by employers, too, as their ability to invest in current staff and future growth is hampered by a requirement to continually top up a burdensome pension scheme.

Increasingly, savers may be required to give up some of their benefits in a compromise deal. For example, firms could promise to pay them more than they might obtain through a PPF rescue  —  but less than they are entitled to in the letter of their contract.

This is something the former pensions minister Baroness (Ros) Altmann, among others, is pushing for.

The problem is about to be subject to two major reviews, including one by the influential Work &amp; Pensions Committee of MPs.

The outcomes are likely to result in further support for similar compromise measures.

What will it mean for workers who depend on these schemes to deliver valuable retirement incomes?

They are known as final salary or &quot;defined benefit&quot; schemes.

While few workers contribute to them today, millions have entitlements built up in the past, when the arrangements were common.

There are 6,000 such schemes, attached to all types of business. Currently 5,000 are in deficit.

The PPF works out a deficit figure based on how much money would be needed to provide the lower level of pension payouts that members would get if the PPF had to step in and rescue the scheme. That figure is currently £383bn.

It is, however, a far smaller shortfall figure than would result if schemes were to pay out everything as promised. This is put at £935bn, according to consultants Hymans Robertson.

These numbers are the worst they&#39;ve ever been. This is because, when working out shortfalls, pension trustees look at their assets and future liabilities and then apply a likely rate of investment return. Because investment returns are currently excruciatingly low, the shortfalls have expanded.

### What happens today when a company can&#39;t pay for pensions?

When a company that operates a final salary pension scheme fails, there is an assessment as to whether the scheme can meet its promises.

If not, it eventually passes to the PPF, which manages the assets of the scheme and pays out to pensioners according to its rules and limits.

Under the PPF rules the majority of already retired members of the scheme will continue to be paid as normal. Most yet-to-retire members will get 90pc of what they were promised. Certain groups  —  such as those who retire early or those with big pensions  —  might get less.

### What form could a compromise take?

Problems arise when companies are not yet insolvent but are still encumbered with schemes whose deficits are huge. &quot;The problem with the system as it is today is that too often trustees and their advisers have not used the flexibilities that already exist, so there are binary outcomes,&quot; said Baroness Altmann, who campaigns on behalf of members of these schemes.

&quot;The company either commits to meeting 100pc of its pension promises, or the PPF takes over.&quot;

She said there were practical solutions that businesses could adopt to reduce the burden.

These include merging small schemes to cut costs and switching the pledge to pay inflation-linked annual increases from a higher to a lower measure of inflation — something that has been implemented across public sector pensions but which some private sector schemes are unable to do without a change in legislation.Please visit the Source content for a functional calculator.

Jonathan Repp of Mercer, a pensions consultancy, is among those who think shortfalls could be narrowed [by moving funds&#39; underlying investments away from government bonds — something that he argues could reduce risk, too](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/chasing-rainbows-jonathan-repp?trk=prof-post).

Far more radical would be arrangements under which savers agreed through negotiations with the company behind the scheme to accept payouts that were less than promised, but still better than those offered by the PPF.

Such a fix was recently mooted for savers in the British Steel scheme.

Joanne Segars, the head of the Pensions &amp; Lifetime Savings Association, which represents pension schemes, said of this suggestion: &quot;It is inconceivable that the Government can consider these changes for the British Steel scheme without also considering amendments for all schemes.&quot;

Baroness Altmann is also fiercely opposed to the idea that individual schemes get &quot;special treatment&quot;, wanting instead agreed procedures that could apply to all.

&quot;There is some flexibility in the system as it exists,&quot; she said. &quot;But where reform is needed it should apply across the board.

&quot;Any reform will inevitably be difficult, because retirees might complain that they are not being paid the exact amount promised. But trying to force an employer to pay every last penny may be counter-productive. &quot;We do not want to make the best the enemy of the good.&quot;
