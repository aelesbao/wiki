# Blockchain in the Pensions Industry

### Blockchain technology is fast gaining traction in many industries with respect to data management and security and as of September 2017 Microsoft have made this in reach of most companies.

A blockchain is a data structure. It is like a public digital ledger of all transactions that are shared amongst a network of computers. This chain keeps growing as new transactions and &#39;blocks&#39; are added to it and when new records are added this creates a linear blockchain. With the help of blockchain the intermediary is no longer needed thus blockchain provides an efficient way for companies to conduct their transactions and verify them without the need for a separate, central authority.

**Why should the pensions industry adopt blockchain?**

In 2016 APG, a Dutch asset management company who oversees the biggest pension fund in the Netherlands, announced that it was looking into the possibility of using blockchain in the fields of financial services and logistics.

Blockchain offers several advantages that the UK pension industry can also benefit from:

- **Security:** Blockchain uses cryptography. This allows each of the participants on the network to the use digital ledger and makes changes in a completely secure way. Therefore, with the help of cryptography, the ledger is public but also safe and trustworthy for clients.
- **Circulation of information:** With blockchain the firm that is using it will not need any separate central authority so that the information can be shared with others. Blockchain provides its users with a shared ledger that can be seen and verified by any participant who have been added to that network.
- **Immutability:** _The meaning of immutability is unchanging._ So, blockchain technology has been designed in a way that once the required changes have been, made there can be no tampering or further amendment. This means that the transactions that are added to the records in that public digital ledger are a 100% accurate and cannot be tampered with anyway. This makes blockchain technology not only safe but completely trust worthy and very open to audit and scrutiny by pension administrators and clients alike.

The pension industry has to handle multiple financial information and transactions and blockchain could make the management of finances and transactions much easier and simpler. The technology is safe so it is guaranteed that the pensions of clients will not be tampered with and they will receive their pension on time and in full with full transparency of the management of the pension fund.

The biggest single advantage of blockchain, compared to older pension technology, is that it is incredibly safe from hackers which make it valuable to the pension industry, or indeed any industry where financial governance and security is a must have. For a hacker to access the public ledger of one network, they would have to hack into every individual computer used in the blockchain, this makes blockchain technology virtually un-hackable.

What Microsoft have done with there announcement of Block Chain as a Service (BaaS), hosted on their Azure platform, is to bridge the gap between blockchain technology and its enterprise deployment on Azure. One of its key areas of focus remains middleware integrations &quot;to make ledgers more approachable for developers and enterprise end users.&quot; Overall, Microsoft&#39;s efforts are directed to ensure that Azure is the preferred way to connect blockchain with the real world.

With cybersecurity being a key boardroom issue of concern, is it not time for this modern approach to securing data to be considered a viable option for the pensions industry?
