# Why life is getting more expensive than inflation suggests, and what that means for you  —  Part I

<img src="/images/library-img/inflation1-2-3/1.jpeg" width="100%" alt="drawing" />

Have you ever felt like everything was getting more expensive  —  fast? Like the prices for everyday goods and services were going up a lot more quickly than inflation numbers suggest?

**If so, you&#39;re not alone**. Many people, especially **young** people, find that **they can&#39;t afford things that used to be consumer economy staple**s  —  including **home ownership**. That&#39;s why an increasing number of _young adults_, from **Japan&#39;s** [**parasite singles**](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/more-adult-americans-live-with-their-parents-and-grandparents-2016-08-11) to **America&#39;s** [**boomerang kids**](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/more-adult-americans-live-with-their-parents-and-grandparents-2016-08-11), is choosing to live with their parents to save money.

But despite what some older people say, it&#39;s not that _millennials_ are lazy and entitled. It&#39;s just that life is getting _a lot_ more expensive than inflation tells us.

Case in point: **Helaine Olen**&#39;s book, **Pound Foolish**, shows that **US** families used to put **50%** of their discretionary income towards housing, healthcare and education. **In the 2000s**, the respective figure was **75%**, leaving just **25%** for everything else.

And it&#39;s not just the staples that are getting more expensive. From clothes to fast food to a drink at your favorite bar, things cost a lot more now than they did _5–10 years ago_.

**In the first part** of this **3-part series**, we&#39;ll explain **why** this is happening. In parts 2 and 3, we&#39;ll focus on the **truth** about inflation, and look at how **cars, clothes** and **homes** are all _significantly_ **more expensive** than they were for our parents.

Let&#39;s start by going over the real, sometimes misleading, definition of inflation.

**What is Inflation, Really?**

The first order of business is to understand what **inflation** _really_ is. Many people think that **inflation** measures how much a static basket of products changes in price over time  —  _but this is wrong_.

In reality, **inflation** figures show how much the average household&#39;s spending changes year-on-year. In the **US**, these spending figures show up in the **Customer Price Index**. In the **EU**, they show up in the **HCIP (Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices)**.

But although the **HCIP**, **CPI** and other indices track a broad basket of items across different categories, they _don&#39;t_ show us the specific products people are buying. This can mask a lot of **inflation**  —  and here&#39;s how.

Let&#39;s say it&#39;s **2018** and the entire state of **Arizona** buys bread for **$1.20**. The brand they buy is called **Arizona Bread** and everyone loves it. But by this time next year, the price of **Arizona Bread** goes up to **$1.50 **  —  so everyone switches to the cheaper (and less delicious) **Oklahoma Loaf** brand.

Now, the way a regular consumer might look at it, bread just got **20%** more **expensive**. But if you look at **inflation figures**, they might show you **0%** inflation because the price of bread stayed the same.

And that&#39;s what **inflation** is. _A change in spending; not a change in the price of specific products._ It&#39;s very important to understand this distinction, because the way **inflation** is calculated masks price shifts that make consumers switch to cheaper products.

Unfortunately, this is just one of several reasons it&#39;s hard to gauge inflation accurately. In fact, for you and hundreds of millions of consumers, inflation can be drastically higher than statistics suggest.

In the next part of this series, we&#39;ll explain _why_ this is the case and take a look at 2 alternative inflation figures: the gold standard and the Big Mac index (yes, the Big Mac index). Then we&#39;ll move on to the _real_ inflation figures for clothes, homes and more.
