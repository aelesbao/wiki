## What is Akropolis
Akropolis is a domain-specific financial protocol dedicated to the needs of the informal economy. It makes it possible for anybody regardless of geography to quickly set up, operate and grow scalable autonomous financial organizations. Most importantly, it enables an inter-operable network between them and external third parties, whereby value can be exchanged freely in a trust-minimised way (e.g. co-invest, loan/borrow, trade) 

## What are autonomous financial organizations? 

Autonomous financial organizations are fully digital organizations that provide financial services and can make decisions independently on their own behalf, as well as on behalf of their owners (individuals or corporations).

## Why are we focused on emerging markets? 

In emerging markets, an informal financial market has been operating for hundreds of years. This market consists of millions of financial organizations, each of which solves the financial problems of their owners. These financial organizations, informal savings groups, hold 100s of billions of US $ 240 bln US $. The principles of the work of the savings groups do very much resemble the principles of the AFO, so we regard them as the initial target audience


## Are we addressed only to emerging markets? 

No. we are not. We believe the future of finance belongs to user-owned networks. Fintech trends confirm that. 
Banks and other financial corporations will be replaced by a huge number of autonomous co-ops, each of which will act in the interests of its owners and interact with other agents in a single digital financial landscape. 



## How do we transform the informal economy into a brand new digital communities? 

We chose the initial target audience to launch our protocol to Africa due to two reasons - the lack of traditional financial system legacy and the rapid penetration of digital technologies. We help informal savings circle leapfrog to member-owned banks. In the same way as EM leapfrogged into telecom and mobile era faster than Europe


## What services can AFOs create? 

The Akropolis protocol allows you to create any cashflow-based financial services that cover most of the existing financial products for retail users: loans/savings/insurance/joint investments etc.




## Which blockchain does Akropolis use? 

Designed as a blockchain-agnostic protocol, Akropolis is currently being implemented on Ethereum, the next iteration will be built using Polkadot, with active R&D underway. 


## What are building blocks of Akropolis protocol?

C2FC, DCDM, Identity Management System,  Bookkeeping and Reputation system. 



## What is C2FC?

Commitments to Future Cashflows  (or C2FC) – a financial primitive that represents a digital right to operate with future cashflow that will arrive in any form to any Ethereum address (now it works in Ethereum, but could be implemented in any blockchain)within a given time frame. Simply put, it looks like a relay: a C2FC issuer must receive payment within this specified period, but those payments are fully or partially forwarded to the C2FC token holder’s address. Therefore, the future cashflow of any individual, company or service takes the form of a measurable digital unit that can be easily exchanged, traded or used as collateral.

## What is DCDM?

The DCDM (Digital Community Decision Making) Framework provides decision support for autonomous financial organizations. The core DCDM API supports a number of base level commands, like registration of new Autonomous Financial Organisation, making changes to its constitution etc. 


## What is Identity Management System? 
IMS is a registry of all users, which keep next records:
* List of all users of the protocol and links to user’s external personal data providers 
* List of all registred AFOs
* List of memberships of users in AFOs. 

## How does the Reputation system work? 

We do not provide scoring and risk assessment within the protocol. The protocol collects and stores information about all financial transactions of agents. Any third-party participant can access financial transactions and assess the risk on their own or use third-parties to assess the risk.
