# 5 Times Pension Schemes Collapsed and Left Millions of People Destitute — Part II

In the first [part](https://medium.com/akropolis/5-times-pension-schemes-collapsed-and-left-millions-of-people-destitute-847f65f36553) of this post, we looked at how **Prichard** , **Alabama** left **150 pensioners**** broke **by taking away their lawful pensions. In this post, we&#39;ll look at** 2** more examples of pension schemes that let retirees down. The first is…

**2. The National Bus Employees Superannuation Trust**

In the 80s, Margaret Thatcher&#39;s government was busy privatizing Britain&#39;s state-run services. One company they broke up and privatized was the **National Bus Company** , which had a particularly excellent employee pension plan.

This **NBS&#39;s** pension plan was aptly called **BEST: the Bus Employees&#39; Superannuation Trust**. Bus drivers and bus crews were often victims of assaults, violence, stress and more — so **BEST** was generous, and allowed for early retirement.

As a result of this, the **BEST** fund had a sizeable surplus at the time it was privatized. The idea was for this surplus to improve retirees&#39; pensions. To that end, **BEST** had an **extra £168 million** , paid by bus drivers and bus crews, to distribute among retirees.

That&#39;s a lot of money — but what happened next was both unfortunate and criminal.

Seeing **the excess £168 million** , the government decided to pocket it prior to privatization. **It had undersold the National Bus Company by £300 million** , so this was its way of making up some of the losses.

Put more simply, the British government sold off a national company… But only after gutting its pension fund and taking **£168 million** from current and future pensioners.

Now, to be fair, **Margaret Thatcher&#39;s government** only took the **surplus** money from **BEST&#39;s** beneficiaries. To be even more fair, a 13-year legal and political campaign **did** end in the Labour Government agreeing to return the money.

But all of that is little consolation. The state had raided the **BEST** fund and gutted it on a whim. **The National Bus Company** employees had to rely on Britain&#39;s national pension — one of the worst-funded in the world — instead.

And that&#39;s the second time a major pension scheme collapsed, leaving millions worse off. Even developed states **can** and **do** take money from pensioners like Britain did in the above example.

Things are even worse for underdeveloped states — as you&#39;re about to see in the next example.

**3. How USSR&#39;s Pensioners Ended Up Penniless**

The **USSR** was a communist nation, meaning _everyone worked for the state or a state-owned company_ — and could count on a state pension after retirement. Unfortunately, **the USSR dissolved in 1991** , leaving its successor state (Russia) to make good on its obligations.

How did this go for Russia&#39;s pensioners?

Well, _after World War 2_, the **USSR** was _the other_ superpower. You&#39;d think that the people who helped build the state would enjoy some of its past prosperity — even during an economic downturn.

**And you&#39;d be wrong.**

By the time the **USSR** dissolved, inflation was running wild and national reserves were empty. There was no money to give state retirees. **So around 1992–1993, the average Russian pensioner got** [**5–15 USD per month**](http://ruxpert.ru/%D0%9F%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B8_%D0%B2_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B8) **.**

**By 1995** , the situation improved… With **pensioners receiving 50 USD** per month. Then came **Russia&#39;s**** 1998** default when things got worse again, with pensions regressing to 19 USD.

At the end of it all, tens of millions of pensioners were living below the poverty line. And this is not to mention that pensions often went unpaid, with the government&#39;s debt to pensioners standing at [**17 trillion Russian Rubles**](https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=21008442) by **1997**.

By sheer magnitude, this is probably the biggest collapse on this list. **USSR&#39;s** workers had no choice but to work for the state. The state was their only source of post-retirement income. And in the end, it failed them completely and unexpectedly.

In the next part of our post, we&#39;ll look at an ancient example of unpaid pensions, then go back to cover modern America&#39;s biggest collapsed private pension fund.
