# Problems 

We set out to address 8 key issues with the current pension and savings infrastructure:

**Savers do not have control over their funds:**

The existing system makes it all too easy for third parties to seize their savings. Individuals also find it difficult to move their savings from one provider to another or from one jurisdiction to another.

**Savers don&#39;t understand what they are paying and whether they will get back their savings:**

Due to the mandatory nature of most pensions systems, there is normally a lack of transparency on charges levied on contributors. An individual does not know if their savings is underperforming, what conditions those savings can be withdrawn or even if their pension scheme is solvent.

**Pension pools are fragmented:**

In some markets such as the UK, pension pools are fragmented and administered by various parties (large employers, municipalities, etc.) due to a variety of legacy issues. This makes it complicated and is inefficient for savers.

**Legacy systems are inefficient:**

Most pension systems run on antiquated and inefficient technology platforms and deliver a poor, high friction user experience. These legacy systems are not closed, difficult to use and inefficient but are also hampering the industry&#39;s ability meet the individualized requirement of the next generation.

**High operating costs for the maintenance of the fund due to the low level of digitalization of business processes:**

Smart Contracts, Tokens, and common language used for communication across the Akropolis platform. The protocol facilitates swift, easy and cost-effective movement and management of capital, tokenized assets, and investment data on the blockchain and within the requisite applications and services.

**The lack of standardization of the interaction of pension funds with each other:**

All the interactions will be regulated by protocol automatic methods, including smart-contracts, blockchain registry and open-source cryptography.

**Savings products are complex:**

Retirement planning does not come naturally to most of us. Yet pension schemes have complicated products that most individuals don&#39;t understand. This combined with the complex and opaque pensions and savings plans make it difficult for users to plan for their retirement.

**Providers are failing to adjust to the consumerization of savings products:**

The pension system with its combination of government, employer and private savings are not adjusting to the retail shift towards individuals. As early as 2012, IBM has identified that pension providers have failed to &#39;individualize&#39; their business, moving away from servicing government bodies or large employees to providing for the needs of individual savers.
