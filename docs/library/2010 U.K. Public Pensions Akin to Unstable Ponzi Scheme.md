# U.K. Public Pensions Akin to “Unstable Ponzi Scheme”

The existing approach to UK public sector pensions has been compared to an &quot;unstable Ponzi scheme&quot; in an independent report from the Public Sector Pensions Commission.

Findings from the commission  —  established last December by organisations including the Institute of Economic Affairs and the Institute of Directors  —  suggested the government had used artificially high discount rates to report unfunded liabilities and a different rate to calculate employer and employee contributions, which appeared to lower the cost of providing public sector pensions. _(See earlier IPE article:_[_UK roundup: ONS and Public Sector Pensions Commission_](http://www.ipe.com/news/uk-roundup-ons-and-public-sector-pensions-commission_33595.php)_)_

The report said the government employed a discount rate based on AA-rated corporate bonds instead of index-linked gilts to calculate liabilities, while public sector employers and employees are &quot;not charged the full current service costs of the liabilities the pension schemes are taking on each year&quot;.

It said a &quot;completely different discount rate&quot; chosen by the government had been used to compute these.

As a result, the [commission](http://www.public-sector-pensions-commission.org.uk/) argued that both employers and employees undervalue the scheme because although they are paying combined contributions of around 20% of salary, the true value based on index-linked gilts is closer to 40% of salary, or even 30% based on long-term gilt returns.

It estimated that, in 2010–11, using the government&#39;s methodology for calculating the annual service cost, these pensions would cost £18.5bn (€22.2bn), of which £4.5bn would come from the Treasury, or the taxpayer.

But the commission said this was an inaccurate measure of the cost, that the figure was closer to £35bn a year and that this is what employers and employees should be paying.

Peter Tompkins, fellow of the institute of actuaries and chairman of the commission, said: &quot;It is a matter both of justice and good economics that public sector employees and employers should bear the full cost of their pension provision as it accrues.

&quot;So long as those contributions are sufficient to pay the public sector pensions of today, the cash flows in and out steadily and in balance.

&quot;Of late, however, the amount the Treasury has to pay to top pensions up has risen and will rise still further into the future.

&quot;Like an unstable Ponzi scheme, it will only work if tomorrow&#39;s generations of new members and taxpayers are able to stomach a higher cost to pay tomorrow for the unfunded promises being made today.&quot;

Tompkins added: &quot;No one change on its own will be enough to control costs if you want to bring costs down to the 20% level people have in mind, rather than a 40% we believe we have shown they are actually costing.&quot;

The commission outlined a number of potential reforms to try and improve transparency and reduce the cost of the public sector pensions to the taxpayer, such as:

A reformed defined benefit option to bring costs down to 20% of salary Reducing the accrual rate to 1/80th or switching to a career average scheme could save £10bn a year Increasing pension age to 65 for all members, which would save £5bn a year Reducing index-linking of pensions from Retail Price Inflation (RPI) to Consumer Price Inflation (CPI), which would save 10% of the costs Increasing employer contributions by 2 percentage points, raising £2bn a year

Other possibilities considered by the commission included moving to a defined contribution or a hybrid scheme, although the report noted each option for reform had its pros and cons.

Tompkins added: &quot;As Greece has been experiencing, increases to retirement ages or cuts in benefits are not popular at the best of times, but implementing them as part of a package of crisis cuts is the least palatable option of all.

&quot;It is essential reforms be conducted early in a measured way rather than waiting until we have a crisis.&quot;

Tompkins repeatedly said he believed existing benefits should be &quot;sacrosanct&quot;.

Of all reform proposals, he said contribution increases were the easiest to put forward.

&quot;It can be a little bit painful because employees are going to have to pay more, as are employers,&quot; he said, adding that this was the way the Irish government had successfully tackled the problem.

He was critical of the government&#39;s proposal to link public-sector pensions to CPI as of next year, saying: &quot;If you&#39;ve promised people an RPI-linked pension for the work they&#39;ve done until now, you should be delivering that.&quot;

The commission calculated that the shift to CPI-linked pensions would gradually reduce the overall public-sector liability from £1.28trn to £1.1trn.

Other proposals put forward recently included an upper limit on public-sector pensions, setting a cap at £50,000 a year.

The chairman said these saved &quot;next to nothing&quot; and were merely &quot;cosmetic&quot;.
