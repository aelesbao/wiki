# Point system

### In this quest, we introduce the point system:

</br>

**1 point is 100 AKT token**

**1 AKT = 0.01 USD**

</br>

1. 	Points can be converted to AKT tokens after a certain threshold. E.g., if **$1 = 1 point**, one will **need at least 150 points to convert them** to AKT.

2. 	Points can be converted to other bonuses, like merch or a visit to meetup, or a certificate, or save them for future community activities (if they don&#39;t meet the threshold of 	150 points)

</br>

### Max fund for quest is 100,000$ in tokens + 20 ETH
