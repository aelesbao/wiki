Our approach is a bottom-up re-write and redesign, centered on a more competitive model, associated infrastructure and necessary tools to create a reliable and hazard-free pension landscape. Akropolis is designed in a way that is inclusive, reliable and transparent. Users do not need to acquire permission to set up funds on Akropolis, which is designed to be owned by token holders over time. Akropolis focuses on a specific use case and seeks to address it in an open-source tradition. Mission Quote We will see many blockchains in the future, regional differentiation - already confirmed empirically, hence inter-chain communication is important. (Olof Karlsson-Wee, Polychain Capital) A paradigm shift is required. We need a whole new model to replace the current broken pensions model: we are building thin slices of the Web3 stack as the rails to help us get there. It is with the decentralised Web3 stack can we believe we can build that which we cannot imagine in a traditional environment? Underlying protocols can lead the emergence of new applications and can drive an ecosystem. Distributed network, where the users of the network are the owners of the network: no adversarial/conflicting relationships between the stakeholders or moral hazard negatively affecting the outcomes for the users.

A place to set up and trade Commitments to Future Cashflows (C2FC), a new financial primitive and a DeFi equivalent of cashflow financing . C2FC bridges traditional finance and Web3 by providing DeFi and Web3 entrepreneurs with capital to grow. Accelerate growth without giving up equity if you are an company or unlock new ways of funding your future if you are an independent. No equity, no fundraising, no dilution No warrants, no covenants, no bullshit Quick way to improve cashflow - get funds in faster Pay back as you grow Simple Acquire more customers Use this dApp made by the Akropolis team to manage C2FC creation, trading and collateralization. Built with MakerDAO + 0x + MetaMask TestNetApp (Kovan) Mainnet App What is C2FC The C2FC is a digital token, which acts as automatically executed right to claim a defined part of the future cashflow that arrives at issuer Ethereum address within a given time frame. C2FC is materially different to the current implementations of ERC948 (EIP 1337) and EIP1620. The improvement is in the following features: Direct debit initialisation by the sender Ability to realize escrow logic for payments receiver Ability to transfer ownership to receive recurring payments: transferred to another person Tokens are composable and can be grouped into a portfolio according to pre-defined characteristics What are the benefits C2FC issuance allows to present future cashflows of any business or individual in as a single token, that can be easily exchanged, traded or used as collateral, thus materially simplifying workflows and opening up a potential for new DeFi instruments and interactions. You can attract additional liquidity without using a 150% ensuring in digital assets by trading C2FC. How does it work An already operating business or an individual who has regular income payments, that needs additional liquidity at the moment can issue C2FC for defined future periods and trade them at marketplace. It looks like exchanging future cashflows for \"money now\" by selling discounted C2FC or borrowing funds, using C2FC as collateral. Are there any risks involved in issuing or trading C2FCs? C2FC issuance itself does not provide any risks until it is involved in the open market. When it is exchanged to other unit of value and changed ownership, there is a risk that future cashflow would be lower than estimated or there would no money arrived at all. This issue primarily is connected with the correct risk assessment of the C2FC issuer. Considering the transparency of the C2FC itself and related indicators, the risk assessment would be no harder and in some cases can even be more reliable than in centralized finance.

Individuals also find it difficult to move their savings from one provider to another or from one jurisdiction to another. Savers don't understand what they are paying and whether they will get back their savings: Due to the mandatory nature of most pensions systems, there is normally a lack of transparency on charges levied on contributors. An individual does not know if their savings is underperforming, what conditions those savings can be withdrawn or even if their pension scheme is solvent. Pension pools are fragmented: In some markets such as the UK, pension pools are fragmented and administered by various parties (large employers, municipalities, etc.) due to a variety of legacy issues. This makes it complicated and is inefficient for savers. Legacy systems are inefficient: Most pension systems run on antiquated and inefficient technology platforms and deliver a poor, high friction user experience. These legacy systems are not closed, difficult to use and inefficient but are also hampering the industry's ability meet the individualized requirement of the next generation. High operating costs for the maintenance of the fund due to the low level of digitalization of business processes: Smart Contracts, Tokens, and common language used for communication across the Akropolis platform. The protocol facilitates swift, easy and cost-effective movement and management of capital, tokenized assets, and investment data on the blockchain and within the requisite applications and services. The lack of standardization of the interaction of pension funds with each other: All the interactions will be regulated by protocol automatic methods, including smart-contracts, blockchain registry and open-source cryptography. Savings products are complex: Retirement planning does not come naturally to most of us. Yet pension schemes have complicated products that most individuals don't understand. This combined with the complex and opaque pensions and savings plans make it difficult for users to plan for their retirement. Providers are failing to adjust to the consumerization of savings products: The pension system with its combination of government, employer and private savings are not adjusting to the retail shift towards individuals. As early as 2012, IBM has identified that pension providers have failed to 'individualize' their business, moving away from servicing government bodies or large employees to providing for the needs of individual savers.","title":"Problems"},{"location":"overview/problems/#problems","text":"We set out to address 8 key issues with the current pension and savings infrastructure: Savers do not have control over their funds: The existing system makes it all too easy for third parties to seize their savings.
