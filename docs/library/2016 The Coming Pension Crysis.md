What&#39;s your dream for retirement? Is it living on the beach, traveling on cruise ships throughout Europe, spending time with kids and grandkids, finally getting the chance to perfect your golf game? For a lot of people, the retirement dream is to retire early enough so that they can enjoy the fruits of their long working career while they&#39;re still healthy and to live out their sunset years relaxing and enjoying the good life.

Workers in the past trusted that the defined benefit pension plans provided by their employers would keep them and their spouse living comfortably through their retirement. And if anything happened with their corporate pension, they figured they had paid into government social security and it would be more than enough to cover things.

Improvements in healthcare are increasing life expectancies meaning retirement money needs to last much longer.

At the same time demographic shifts — an increase in the retirement age population accompanied by a decrease in the working age population — are starting to put a strain on pay-as-you-go government pension schemes such as social security.
