## What is Akropolis
Akropolis is a domain-specific financial protocol dedicated to the needs of the informal economy. It is designed to:

* enable anybody regardless of geography to quickly set up, operate and grow informal autonomous financial organisations (AFOs), e.g. digital co-ops, guilds, mutuals

* enable a previously impossible interoperable scalable network between them and external third parties, whereby value can be exchanged freely in a trust-minimised way (e.g. co-invest, lend/borrow, trade). 

* reduce instances of fraud and misuse of funds
