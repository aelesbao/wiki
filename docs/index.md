## What is Akropolis

As a project, Akropolis mission is to give people the tools to save, grow and provision for the future safely and without dependence on a geography, a central counterparty, or falling prey to predatorial financial practices of multiple intermediaries.

With that in mind, Akropolis has built AkropolisOS, light and modular framework for creating for-profit DAOs, with customisable user incentives, automated liquidity provision enabled by the bonding curve mechanism, and programmatic liquidity and treasury management.

Our first product, Sparta, allows taking undercollateralized loans (borrower provides only 50% of collateral), as well as to passively generate yield via integrated yield rebalancer to get maximum available APR from different DeFi protocols. All funds are pooled, and the internal economy is based on a bonding curve, which provides additional incentives to the users. 
Most projects in DeFi space provides only overcollateralized loans (~150% collateral), thus their target audience is mostly speculators (taking loans to trade) or tech-savvy people (available to utilize flash loans for arbitrage). We give people the opportunity to actually take a loan for their needs, not speculation, and incentivize them to do so along the way with automated liquidity provision, bonding curve, passive yield from different DeFi protocols and liquidity mining.

Another product weâ€™re developing is Delphi, a pool which allows executing automatic dollar-cost averaging into BTC&ETH (thus diversifying long-term investment portfolio) and participating in different yield harvesting (liquidity mining) possibilities (earning COMP, BAL, etc passively).
